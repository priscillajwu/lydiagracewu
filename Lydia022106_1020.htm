<B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Dear Brothers and sisters,</P>

<P>&#9;Today, Lydia read some information about radiotherapy and chemotherapy (selectively) with Mom.  Later, I called Lydia from work.  She could explain quite well to me.  Then she told me she is working on the thank you notes.  She seems happy.</P>
<P>&#9;I asked Lydia, &quot;Are you feeling sad?&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;No, why?&quot; Lydia answered.</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;You were sometimes sad.&quot; I said.</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Well, not now really.&quot;  She laughed.</P>
<P>&#9;She really lighted up my day.</P>
<P>&#9;Lydia asked for mommy to go shopping.  She said she were not able to go around much and hasn’t been outside for a long time.  So, Jean took her to T.J. Maxx about an hour.  Then, Lydia was tired and came home and rest.  She was really excited.  Think about it.  She was easily satisfied with only one hour outdoor trip…</P>
<P>&#9;Thank brothers and sisters’ prayer and offer to help taking care of the children.  With your prayers, all of them were quite happy since this morning.  Everyone had a good night of sleep last night.  Again, God has answered the prayers.  Praise the Lord.</P>
<P>&#9;I have been quite worried about tomorrow’s MRI.  But I am sure everything is in God’s hand.  He loves us and will take care of us, His children.  Therefore, I got peace in mind.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In Him,</P>
<P>Simon</P>
