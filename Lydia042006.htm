<P>My dear prayer heroes,</P>
<P>Lydia’s third party pathology report (from John Hopkins) showed that her tumor is much aggressive (mixed with different types) of this disease. So, cure rate is lower, the re-lap rate is higher…</P>
<P>Well, well, We should not scare or worry. With God’s healing and promise, the cure rate or re-lap chance do not really matter. They were just the numbers, the statistics. Let’s keep hope on our God, which has all we need. Although the results are scary, that means we need to totally rely on our Lord.</P>
<P>In today’s clinic check up. The radiation oncologist commented that Lydia’s reaction and reception to the radiation treatment was really good. Thank the Lord.</P>
<P>All the doctors and nurses seemed so interested in Lydia every time when she was in hospital. People liked to talk to her. She has a special charm. It must be God’s mercy and grace.</P>
