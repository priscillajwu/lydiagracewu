<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P>May 2, 2006, Tuesday</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Today, after more than two months since Lydia’s last brain surgery, the last big piece of scabs finally took off. We have been watching it for weeks. It’s now finally gone. Praise the Lord.</P>
<P>Before bedtime, Lydia quietly packed her school bag, and sneaked to the pile next to the door where all the school bags should be (so that next morning, it will be easier for the children to pick up and head for school), and put her bag next to her sister’s.</P>
<P>Lydia’s school backpack has been missing from that pile for a long time. Nowadays, only three other kids’ school bags are there before bedtime.</P>
<P>Lydia is certainly very happy to be able to do that, pack it and put it in the right place and be ready for school next day, just like she has been doing for years.</P>
<P>Mom noticed it, laughed and said, "Hey, what are you doing?"</P>
<P>"Nothing." Lydia was little embarrassed and ran away.</P>
<P>I saw it and tears quickly came to my eyes. So much she has to go through, only to have the privilege to pack the school bag and get ready for school next day!</P>
<P>We really need to appreciate what we have and what we can do and thank our God daily.  Nothing should be taken for granted.</P></FONT></BODY>
