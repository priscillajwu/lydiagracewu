<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I think I had one of the worst
weeks since Lydia passed away, very painful and sorrowful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I am surprised that I was able to
get through this week without people around me noticed much about it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I guess I had to.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Otherwise, it would have been even more difficult.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The weekend was full of
activities, definitely more than the usual weekends.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>And it started early Friday that Deborah left out of town with
school orchestra and I went to high school as a guest speaker in a language
class (or third flat tire incident within one month one day earlier…).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Then, all the weekend chores, led
bible study, prepared and taught Sunday school, took kids to activities.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And on top of that, high school prom was in
this weekend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>My house was gathering
place for several couples.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So, a lot of
preparation for mom and dad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I had to
cut grass (for them to take nice pictures).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>And then lawn mower broke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I did
fix it and finish mowing before the arrival of exciting high school kids.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After sending them off to take limo, all the
restaurants were so crowded that we have to drive around to find a place to eat
and relax.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We also had to wait for the
high schoolers to come back from prom and then sending them off back to high
school for after prom activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And
that was late in the night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Not any
easier today, church meeting in the afternoon after tiring morning, and air
condition in my car suddenly broke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Then, attending concert with Deborah performing Beethoven’s No. 5
symphony.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of course, we were late
because of downloading the prom pictures before we left home.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the evening, the printer broke so kids
could not print nice copy of their homework due tomorrow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>However, think back, are these
burdens or blessings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For the troubled
mind, they were definitely burdens and could drive me crazy and irritable.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thank the Lord, He kept reminding me that
these were blessings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Indeed, they ARE
fun stuff for normal and sane people (we are talking about kids attending prom
and performing symphony No.5).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And
these activities kept the family going.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Although sometimes I was just auto-pilot, I guess my problem is that I
still wonder why Lydia was not in the orchestra playing cello.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Mom made a comment over the
weekend that the younger two girls required a lot of attention than
before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then, all of sudden, we
realized that Lydia, although being a kid herself and need parents’
attention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But she was giving a lot of
attention to the siblings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She helped
taking care of siblings and keeping them busy, relieving mom and dad.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now, nobody could help.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Attention giving job came back to mom and
dad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
