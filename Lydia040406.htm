</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>After each radiation these days, Lydia felt very down, and cried often.  Her scalp hurts, stomach hurts badly, and throat hurts whenever she talks.</P>
<P>&quot;Could God take away my pain?&quot; Lydia asked, &quot;When will my life be normal again?</P>
<P>&quot;Well, you know the answers to all of that.&quot;  Mom Said, &quot;Does whining help?&quot;</P>
<P>Lydia shook her head.  &quot;But I am so painful, I don’t feel good.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So, what should we do?&quot; Mom asked.</P>
<P>&quot;Pray.&quot; Lydia answered.</P>
<P>&quot;Lord Jesus, please take away my pain, please take away my pain….&quot; Lydia prayed.</P>
<P>It was difficult for Mom at those moments.</P>
<P>Besides, Lydia did not like </FONT><A HREF="100_7655.JPG"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>her look</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4> with very few hairs. She thought that it was creepy. Well, to tell the truth, it is a little scary for little kids to look at it.</P>
<P>"I think we should shave all the hair now." Mom told Lydia. </P>
<P>Lydia did not answer.</P>
<P>"How about if Daddy did it with you?" Mom asked again.</P>
<P>Lydia nodded and smiled.</P>
<P>So, we had a hair cut tonight. Everybody took turns to cut Daddy and Lydia’s hair. It was a lot of fun for the entire family.</P>
<P>Lydia does look a lot nicer now. Indeed, she looks very </FONT><A HREF="100_7734.JPG"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>cute</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>.</P>
<P>Praise the Lord. We should be joyful and content. (Philippians 4:12-13)</P>
