<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P>August 14, 2006, Monday</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Thank you for your fasting and prayers.  Lydia’s neurological conditions seemed to stay the same as yesterday, maybe a slightly better.</P>
<P>Several observations,</P>
<OL>

<LI>She could urinate within 5 to 10 minutes after she got on the portable toilet seat.</LI>
<LI>Her right leg was able to move by herself a little bit.  That was better than yesterday.</LI>
<LI>She seemed to be more alert and awake more today than yesterday.  She even agreed to watch some TV when her siblings visited.  (She has not watching TV since admitted into hospital last Tuesday.)</LI>
<LI>She got bowl movement today, first in almost a week.</LI></OL>


<P>Lydia’s piano teacher came to visit her, only hours after they got off the plane from a month long trip (One month ago, Lydia was still in pretty good shape).  When asked whether she practiced piano, </P>
<P>&quot;I have quitted the piano, I can no longer play (because of the disease).  Mom, I have told you.&quot;  Lydia answered.</P>
<P>We were very embarrassed at that moment.  None of several adults on the spot could say anything to comfort her.  It’s very sad for her to say that, and for us to hear it.  Only a few seconds later, Lydia pulled out her hands out of her cover and with the hand motion pretending play piano.  We all laughed.  She is still a sweet girl.</P>

<P>She continues to be very optimistic with good spirits, (still occasionally in bad mood).</P>
<P>A few quotes from her today,</P>
<P>&quot;I am going to get well.  I need to get better.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I need to stay strong.&quot; She said it with her fist in the air.</P>
<P>&quot;I know Lord Jesus is going to help me to get well.  He always helps me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you mommy, thank you daddy.  Without mommy and daddy, I won’t be able to survive.&quot;  She continued, &quot;Well, God first, mommy and daddy closely second.&quot;</P>

<P>Please continue praying (fasting if you have the burden from the Holy Spirit) for Lydia.  Please have faith like Lydia when praying.  If we do not have enough faith, we can ask for it (Mark 9:24).  It’s very important to pray for God’s healing with true faith.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I don’t know how to share the following.  It’s very difficult.</P>
<P>Late in the night, Lydia wetted the bed and lost the control of bowl movement, while she was asleep.  With the urine and loose stool all over her body and bed, she had no clue what happened.  Three times this happened today.  She is now wearing pull-up diaper.</P>
<P>This hit us very very hard.  Is it further tumor damage to her spinal cord?  Our spirits went to the bottom…</P>
<P>We were badly discouraged and in great sorrow, and kept asking God why?  God put the story of Peter walking on the water into my mind.  Peter was about to sink when he saw the strong wind.</P>
<P>I should not doubt.  The doubter will not receive anything from the Lord (James 1:7)</P>
