<p><span style='font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Arial'>July 30, 2006, Sunday<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>It was the end of summer
swimming season. She has been swimming every year, the same as all her
siblings. This summer, while all her same age teammates and all her siblings
were practicing and racing, Lydia was in and out of hospital, suffering from
severe side effects of chemotherapy, struggling to go through everyday.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Yesterday was the final
swim meet with the entire league. Determined and wished to keep this annual
event, she wanted to go pretty bad. Yesterday morning, she went and swam with
all her strength. The only bold head girl swimmer, she was cheered and
applauded by many swimmers, coaches, and parents (many standing). When she got
out of water with both arms held by mom, there was a smile on her pale face. As
the father, I tried to video tape it. However, I did not get a good shot. I was
too emotional at the moment. My eyes were blurred with too much water (tears),
and my hand was probably shaking…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>As Esther shared yesterday,
the true hero can come in different form.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Our little hero was in good
mood yesterday. However, she has been a suffering patient today. The headaches
were so severe. None of her pain medicines would do any good to relieve her
pain. That was very rare. Even more rare is that she could not even watched TV.
We were out of means to help her. Again, we almost brought her to ER at night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>We put Lydia to the bed.
All of us (mom, dad, and all the sisters) massaged her, on her head, legs,
feet, belly… We surrounded her, more than seven or eight hands worked on her at
the same time. It must be pretty comfortable. She was able to fall asleep
eventually. It marks the end of this weekend, with very highs and lows.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>May the name of the Lord be
praised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
