<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Dear colleagues,</span> </p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Once again, I really would like to express
my family's sincere appreciation for your prayers, love and supports. It did
help us and Lydia greatly. Lydia likes the gifts very much. She recovered from
last surgery so well, and was able to keep spirits up. I really have to thank
you for that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>The most recent development, actually,
confirmed and decided just today, after we met with the team of doctors in
Children Hospital (neurosurgeon, radiologists, oncologists...) They believed
that there is still residual tumor left in her brain. They suggested a second
surgery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Although neurosurgeon strongly believed that
all of the tumors have been removed in the first operation, but the
post-operation MRIs and third-party opinions (including nationally well-known
exports on this disease), all suggested that about one inch size of tumor is
still there. For the best interest for Lydia, the votes overwhelmingly towards
another operation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>This is a very difficult, heart aching,
stomach wrenching experience for us. We asked a lot of questions to the
doctors, &quot;How come....&quot; , &quot;What if.....&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>After considering many aspects, and risks
involved, at the end, we all agreed.</span> </p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Lydia was OK with it. With all the pain and
suffering she endured last time, I am amazed she could take it so well
(probably because her recovery went so well, or maybe she forgot already ...?
Or she is not afraid because so many people are behind her....) I am very proud
of her. I am sure you will be too. (Many of her stories, I put in a very simple
web site.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>http://www.immanuel.net/masoncc/Lydia_Update/UpdateCalendar.htm</p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>The surgery will be next Monday, Feb. 27,
7:30 AM. Seventeen days after the first operation (2/9).</span> </p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Thank you for your prayer and thoughts for
Lydia. Please feel free forward this to your family or friends.</span> </p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Regards</span> <br>
<span style='font-family:Arial'>Simon</span> </p>
