<p><span style='font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Arial'>June 28, 2006, Wednesday<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>I got up early in the
morning (although stayed up extremely late last night, actually, this morning)
with heavy burden in my heart, wondering why Lydia’s blood counts were still
low. According to the doctors, most of the children chemo patients would have
blood counts up by now…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>I prayed and prayed.
Knowing God has been carrying us through many difficult situations, why would
this time be any different?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>I deeply believe and have
faith in our Lord. However, I was very anxious to find out the blood test
results.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Jean called. THE NUMBERS
WERE UP. Praise the Lord. I was so relieved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>There was no need of blood transfusion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Our God again answered our
prayers. What we are experiencing is that our God is faithful, He is so real,
so true, so comforting, and provides us great hope deep in our hearts and
souls…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>We are truly blessed.
Although the journey is hard, but it’s the life lesson we have to take, the
lesson God specially designed for us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Thank you for your prayers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
