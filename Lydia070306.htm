</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Lydia’s doctor appointment in the morning was re-scheduled to the afternoon.  So we got a free morning and went to the zoo.</P>
<P>That was a right choice.  Lydia </FONT><A HREF="100_9513.JPG"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>fed the animals</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4> and had a lot of fun.  Thank God for His creation is always the best.</P>
<P>In the hospital visit, Lydia is doing OK in everything (red blood cell count was still low), only that she has further lost another two pounds.</P>
<P>To feed Lydia or to increase (or just to maintain) her weight has been so challenging for us, the doctors, and the dieticians.  Please pray for that.</P>

<P>Lydia and Priscilla wanted to camp (sleep in the tent) in the back yard, I said no.</P>
<P>And, I considered going out to see the fourth of July firework is not a good idea for Lydia either.  Finally, we let Lydia and Priscilla sleep in the family room sofa bed.  They were really excited.  The kids were so easily satisfied with small things.  </P>
<P>Oh, Lord, make me be content.  I have been having too much frustration and heartaches lately.  I need to have heavenly peace in my heart.  I long for spiritual strength, peace and joy.</P>
<P>It’s now late in the night, seeing Lydia and Priscilla sleeping tightly.  I praise the Lord.  </P>
<P>It’s so peaceful…</P>
