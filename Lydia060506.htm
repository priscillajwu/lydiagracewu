<P>Lydia attended her elementary school graduation ceremony tonight.</P>
<P>Several times, Lydia had tears and suffered from headache while she was working on her school work.  She wanted to graduate with her friends.  But four months ago, we would not know if this could come true.</P>
<P>When her name was called and she </FONT><A HREF="205_0589.JPG"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>went on the stage</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4> to receive her certificate, many people in the audience applauded for her. Hearing the big cheering for Lydia, and seeing the big hugs from the teacher and principal on the stage, I had to wipe the corner of my eyes while I was video taping it. It really got me terribly emotional at that moment.</P>
<P>Our God is so good and amazing.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We received the school musical &quot;Honk Jr.&quot; DVD today, which Lydia was one of the cast.  In the beginning, the dedication showed on the screen…</P>
