sadness, but yet we need to praise God because He brings comfort and peace
to&nbsp; us all when we face these difficulties.&nbsp; We can only come to him
for comfort because He is our Heavenly Father with everlasting love.&nbsp; Over
the weekend while we were in New York City, we received news that Benjamin's
school principal, passed&nbsp;away suddenly.&nbsp;He was young, strong, handsome,&nbsp;with
the kindest heart.&nbsp; &nbsp;He was a dear dear friend to us.&nbsp; We loved
him and his wife dearly and had developed a very special friendship over the
past seven years.&nbsp; He was so looking forward for Benjamin to return from
his New York concert and was planning on celebrating with him.&nbsp; He
suddenly fell ill last Friday, was sent to the hospital early Saturday morning,
and went to be with the Lord on Sunday morning.&nbsp; He and his wife have
dedicated their entire lives to serving God.&nbsp; They, like your family, have
truly lived a Christ-like life.&nbsp; LBA is not just a school.&nbsp; It is a
mission to bring young children up in the way God wants us to so&nbsp;that they
will not go astray.&nbsp; The principal stood at the front door every morning
and afternoon to greet the children and see them off in the afternoon.&nbsp; He
is now gone.&nbsp;The image of him not being there is unbearable.&nbsp;
&nbsp;The first thing that came to my mind was, &quot;He must be playing with
Lydia now.&quot;&nbsp; When he passed away, his wife said, &quot;He is happy
playing with the children in heaven now.&quot;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><i>It has been so difficult.&nbsp; Please pray for his
wife and his parents.&nbsp; He and his wife did not have any children.&nbsp; He
loved all his students like his own children.&nbsp; We have truly experienced
his love for us and Benjamin.&nbsp; It will be a very long and lonely road for
his wife.&nbsp; She just recovered from her chemotherapy from cancer a few
months ago and has now lost her husband.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>We continue to pray for you and the principal’s
family.&nbsp; We loved him just like we loved Lydia.&nbsp; May God grant us all
peace and hope as we all continue to battle with the pain...</p>
