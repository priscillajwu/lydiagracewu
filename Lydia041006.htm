<P>Lydia had the 19<SUP>th</SUP> radiation treatment today. One more day, the first part of radiation (which treats the whole brain and spinal cord) would be finished. Then, 11 more days of local radiation (the region where the tumors were) continues.</P>
<P>One week ago, Lydia was in terrible shape because she suffered from several side effects resulted from the radiation. Doctor said she may not get easier until first part of radiation finishes. </P>
<P>I did not see how could Lydia continue to get worse. We had prayed in despair. Thank God for He answered our prayers.</P>
<P>Doctor was surprised to see that Lydia was doing all right today. Praise the Lord. We were very happy to see Lydia has less suffering.</P>
<P>However, during the exam, Lydia’s coordination seemed not as good as before. In the afternoon, Lydia did not even have the strength for a half mile walk, and hardly balanced herself at the end of walk.</P>
<P>"Could it be because the tumors have grown and pressed some of the brain tissues?" Mom said to me. A big chill came to my entire body when I heard that.</P>
<P>We were so worried. After I got off from work, I took her and walked for another half mile (with a lot of encouragement). She was OK and finished the walk (although got cramps). Maybe the coordination problem was just from the weakness.</P>
<P>We pray for tomorrow’s MRI (2:30PM). It’s very difficult to me. I am very stressed and honestly, very scared. It’s just worse than most of the scary moments in my life. </P>
<P>I have prayed many many times today. I pray for the positive results. I trust in the Lord. May God hold me through and give me peace, faith, and strength. Thank the Lord.</P>
<P>In Him,</P>
<P>Simon</P></FONT></BODY>
