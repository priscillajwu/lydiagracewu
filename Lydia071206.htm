</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Thank the Lord Lydia’s abdominal ultrasound results were good.  They had some concerns, later decided that was not an issue.  Thank you for your prayers.</P>
<P>We talked to many doctors and nurses today for a lot of treatment options and many other topics.  We thank God that we are in good hands.</P>
<P>We were able to use the nauseous medicines better this time.  The dose and the frequency were applied in the ways able to help Lydia better.</P>
<P>Lydia may be able to go home tomorrow.  Lydia is really excited about it.</P>
<P>We really thank God for He truly watches over Lydia.  With prayer, cast all things in God’s hand.  We have peace in mind.</P>
