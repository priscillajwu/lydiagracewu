<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Dear Friends,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>“Go,
go, go! Move! We have to get 1000 bags around this track by 10:00! GO!” This
was probably the most frequent command coming out of my mouth during the
stressful hours before the Luminaria Ceremony at Relay for Life this year. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>Planning
for this 18-hour event goes on almost all year, every month except for the
summer months. The committee, which includes me, meets a couple times every
month to try to figure out how to occupy 1000 teenagers for 18 hours, and also
give them a sharp awakening as to the reality of cancer and those it affects.
Unfortunately, despite the serious nature of the event, most of the
participants tend to see the event as a purely social activity, and don’t
appreciate the importance it holds for cancer survivors, victims, and their
families. My mind immediately flashes to several kids who jumped the fence in
order to illegally leave the event. Or the disrespectful ones who trash talked
the co chairs in charge of the event. I shake my head in frustration. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>However, then I think about
the Luminaria ceremony, which I was in charge of. So much planning and stress
went into it. I spent hours behind a booth taking down names for the Luminaria
bags. But honestly, I never resented any of it. It is the climax, the peak, the
most important hour of the event, because people are reminded about cancer and
all those it has affected. I’m more than happy to help the participants of the
event remember their loved ones, or honor those who are still fighting the
disease. And the event, itself…wow. I never realized how many of my friends had
cancer in their families as well. Before Lydia was diagnosed, I think I was
just blind. I knew people had cancer but I saw it very infrequently. Now,
everywhere I go, I see cancer ravaging lives left and right. The veil before my
once innocent eye has been lifted, and now I see the damage and the pain, and I
experience it myself. I listened to story after story of how almost everyone
had experienced the fear resulting from cancer diagnosis. And it was then that
I realized that despite all the work, the few disrespectful people, and the
stress, THIS was why I was still helping with the event. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Everyone deals with pain and
grief a little differently. But all like to see their loved ones remembered and
honored. And these cancer survivors and victims deserve it. They truly do. This
year’s Relay wasn’t as emotionally painful as last year’s one was for me. It
has been almost two years since my precious little sister passed away. Time has
flown by in a way, yet also crawled. People’s lives are moving on, and I need
to get on that train before it leaves. Lydia would have wanted her beloved
family to keep living life to the fullest. And that is what I will try to do.
However, Relay is something I will never let go of. Relay was important to me
because of Lydia. And Relay is and always will be important to me because it
gives me a chance to pour out my love and sympathy for all those in similar
circumstances. I never would have understood had I not gone through it as well.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>This event showed me that I
will always love doing Relay. I also saw that no matter what the state of your
friendship is, true friends will know when you need them, and they WILL be
there for you, to hold you while you cry, listen while you talk, and say I love
you when you need it most. And finally, that loved ones are never forgotten, so
Relay will always continue, and I will continue doing Relay. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Thanks to our extended
family and friends who pray and support us through this event!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
