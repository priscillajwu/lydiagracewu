</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>We got up early in the morning, and got blood test for Lydia again.  The blood counts have maintained the same level as Wednesday.  We though it should continue going up, but it didn’t.  However, we still thank God at least we can keep some light activities for Lydia.</P>
<P>Today, there was a farewell luncheon for a family in our bible study group who is moving away.  Lydia wanted to go very much.  Considering her blood counts were OK, so we all went to the restaurant, the entire family.</P>
<P>All the kids were sitting on the same table.  Lydia was happy to meet her friends.  However, soon she got really emotional and started crying.  Mom has to take her home early.  Knowing that her friends were able to have a lot of fun, like going to the summer retreat, which Lydia has been going for years and always had a lot of fun, must make her sad.  Moreover, she has no clues what her friends talked about, since Lydia was not involved.</P>
<P>It must be hard for Lydia.  But we thank God that Priscilla will be with Lydia for the entire weekend when two older sisters are in the summer retreat.  </P>
