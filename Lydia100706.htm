today from a ten years old boy who was in Lydia’s Sunday school class.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(He mentioned about AWANA which is the name
of our church children program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Children
memorize bible verses and learn bible lessons every week.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>“<span style='color:black'>I got to know Lydia since
we were in 2<sup>nd</sup> grade at church’s Sunday School and AWANA, and I
consider her as my good friend. She cared about people and she was always
willing to help others. When we were in Sunday School class, it seems that
Lydia knew all the answers, and was eager to share her thoughts. She was a
happy girl, and she laughed a lot. Another thing I remember her is the way she
talks, and I could never figure out how she could talk that fast, and how much
she has to say. At AWANA games, Lydia could run as fast as many of the boys,
and was helping her teammates get ready when she finished her turn. When I
asked my 5 year old brother what he remembered about Lydia, He said, Lydia tied
my shoes.</span></span></i><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class=MsoBodyText><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Since
Sparky class, we were at the same AWANA class every week. Lydia always tried
her best to memorize many Bible verses, and that inspired me to memorize as
much as possible as well. We tried to see who can finish the book first.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>She was always positive and cheered people
up, when they were down. She always was determined to do her best. She would
participate in the games and not anticipate.</span></i><i><span

<p class=MsoBodyText><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Lydia’s
life is short, but Jesus has made BEAUTIFUL things in her life and through her.
I’m thankful that I had the opportunity to get to know her. She inspired and
touched a lot of people. Her spirit still lives on. This September, I was
invited to be a guest pianist to perform at Northern Kentucky University’s
2006- 2007 season opening concert. The piece I played was Bach’s F Minor
concerto. This concerto was hard for me. While I was practicing everyday, I
became so frustrated that I wanted to quit. But my mom asked me, “What would
Lydia do?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I thought that even in the
most difficult situations, she never gave up. I was encouraged by her spirit
and kept on practicing. Bach was a fine Christian. For each piece he composed,
he would write “To God be the Glory”. About 300 years ago, Bach wrote this
concerto. Today, I had this opportunity to play it on stage. I tried to play
Lydia’s story through the music, because I was truly inspired by her courage,
love, hope, and most importantly, her faith to God. After the concert, a lady
told me, “You played very well. Bach would have been very happy.” My mom told me
that God would be happy too. I also believed that Lydia would be glad to hear
that her story inspired people through this piece. May God’s name be glorified.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
