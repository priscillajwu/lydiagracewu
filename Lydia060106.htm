</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>As of today, Lydia has finished most her school work she missed during the last four months.  Praise the Lord, for He is amazing.  Through the help of school principal, teachers, staffs, and home tutor,  she should be able to graduate from elementary school (fourth grade) next week, and continue fifth grade this fall in middle school.  Although life is difficult for her now, there is still hope and progress there.</P>
<P>Lydia received a gift of a huge puzzle, put together by about 30 young adults (college students and young professionals).  None of them knew Lydia before.  They learned about Lydia through friends.  It took them 6 weeks to put the puzzle together to show the love, support, thoughts, and prayers, for Lydia.</P>
<P>May God’s name be glorified through Lydia’s story.</P>
<P>Life is precious, and the trials make it even more apparent, deep in our souls.</P>
