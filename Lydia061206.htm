</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Today, Lydia started her first chemotherapy.</P>
<P>It was several hours of waiting before blood test came back showing everything was OK. After more than two months at home, Lydia was back to the hospital room this afternoon.</P>
<P>With highly toxic chemotherapy, she needs to urinate every hour to make sure kidney would not get damaged, days and nights for several days. It was quite a burden while with IV stand and suffering from nausea. During the process, she needs to drink a lot of water, and get fluid through IV. Although she is quite an experienced patient now, I could still see her struggle to get up to bathroom or eating or drinking…</P>
<P>According to the nurse, the serious nauseous feeling usually may not start until couple days later. However, she felt very nauseous already in the evening. Several different high dose anti-nauseous medicines were ordered. However, the medicines seemed always slow to help relieve her discomfort.</P>
<P>Lydia lost more weight, compared with one week ago.  I was always concerned about it.  Recall I was piggybacking her around during the vacation last weekend, she was so light, like a super long baby if you hold her up.</P>
<P>Her blood pressure once dropped to 60 / 30 this afternoon. There was quite a bit of concern among the nurses and doctors. She was closely monitored.</P>
<P>During the night, I took all her sisters to visit Lydia. That cheered up Lydia wonderfully. Lydia talked and laughed, (and ate ice cream) with sisters. I almost have to believe having sisters on her bedside was the best medicine.</P>
<P>Overall, I am thankful everything is going all right. Thank you for your prayers. Knowing many prayers were with us, God really gave us peace and comfort. For that, we thank you and praise the Lord.</P></FONT></BODY>
