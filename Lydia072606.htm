<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;I can not stand it
any more…&quot; Lydia said it again and again. No exaggeration, probably
hundreds of times today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>She was under tremendous
suffering for the entire day, both physically and emotionally. She had
headache, itchy skin all over her body, stomach ache, numbing leg, and feet,
and of course, extremely nauseous all the time. She was not able to walk
normally. She cried, screamed, crawled on the floor, and said something very
weird, something a normal person would not say. Something she said either made
us very sad, or angry, or even scared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Toward midnight, she was on
the verge of giving up everything. We prayed and prayed and prayed. She would
slap herself on the head, on her body, on her legs. Looking at her, I think, if
it’s me under so much pain and suffering, would I rather die… That was exactly
what she was thinking (according to mom, while I was not home, Lydia said that
quite a few times).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Oh, Lord, why so much
suffering. Can you, the almighty God, relieve our burden a little bit…<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I pray.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
