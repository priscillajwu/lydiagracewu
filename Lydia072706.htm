</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P>Lydia had another day of many various check-ups, kidney function, hearing, eye sight, blood counts…, etc.  Chemotherapy might cause permanent damages of many body functions.  Some could come years from now.  We need to do the similar check up and monitoring for next 10 years.  Really, having healthy kids is true blessing.  Never take that for granted.</P>
<P>Lydia had second acupuncture treatment today.  We also took home another half dozen prescriptions for her.  She felt better tonight.  She even sang songs to Priscilla.</P>
<P>Compared with yesterday, today is like being in the heaven.  Thank God for answering our prayers, for He truly has great mercy and grace.</P>
<P>Praise the Lord.</P>
