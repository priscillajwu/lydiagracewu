<BR>
Just received Simon's update. 7:50am Lydia was doing fine in her way to the <BR>
operation room. She had moment of fear but quickly overcame by her parents <BR>
strong prayer. We took pictures and video in front of the operation room. <BR>
10:00 am report the operation was going on smoothly. There was no further <BR>
details at this time. Please keep your prayer steadfastly. Thank you. We <BR>
will keep you updated. God bless.<BR>
