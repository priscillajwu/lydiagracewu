<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>It’s now the third week of
Lydia’s second chemotherapy. It seems now that Lydia’s second chemotherapy was
worse than her first chemotherapy (although the first week of her second chemo,
we felt that the second time was better than the first time).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>This exactly showed that we
could do very little. We thought we could do better. No, not really, only if we
can totally trust in the Lord. Then, better or worse, God is always watching
us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia’s conditions could
change several times a day. Recent days, we do not go by days, but go by hours.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>To my surprise, Lydia still
wanted to go the summer camp held by the Children’s hospital. Somehow she is
feeling comfortable there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>She threw up during the
ride to the camp, feeling pretty sick while she was there, and she had tough
time during the night after she came home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>By the time she came home
from the camp in the afternoon, all her siblings were heading out for the swim
meet and party afterwards. Lydia had to watch her sisters go out having fun
while she was in severe suffering.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia was in deep sorrow
tonight, home alone with mom. That troubled me a lot. I could not limit the
activities of her siblings. That is not right. However, keep her siblings at
home usually help Lydia to cope with her suffering.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>I pray to God, please give
me wisdom of what to do in a daily bases…<o:p></o:p></span></p>
