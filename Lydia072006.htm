</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Lydia woke up this morning, with very severe headache. She threw up right away in the bed. She screamed and cried with so much pain and suffering. After a few hours, the situation did not improve. Mom had to call the doctors, and was told to rush to the hospital.</P>
<P>Upon arriving at the hospital, Lydia was soon admitted, and blood was drawn right away. Her blood cell counts was very low as expected, and need blood transfusion. Her white blood cell count was lower than100 compared with 4500-13500 normal range.</P>
<P>We still did not know what is causing her so much head pain. MRI is critical at this point. Thank God that we were able to get a slot to have MRI done this evening (still a struggle to go through it). We pray for the good results from MRI.</P>
<P>By the time I left the hospital, Lydia was still under the blood transfusion. Being in the hospital, Lydia seemed to be more peaceful.</P>
<P>It was chaotic this morning at home, and many things happened after that. However, we should be thankful it did not happen during the middle of the night. We were able to see our own doctors today pretty soon instead of waiting in the ER (usually it would take forever).</P>
<P>While we were still happy that Lydia’s second chemotherapy has gone better than last time, we are now back to the hospital. Isn’t it something?  We need to be more alert, or we need to take things easier.</P>
<P>The lessons learned for me today is that, trust in God, and keep on the watch with prayers.</P>
