</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Finally, the funeral arrangement has been settled (with a lot confusion and back and forth communications).  It looked so impossible yesterday.  God is graceful for He sent many brothers and sisters in the Lord to help, and took away a lot of burden from us.</P>
<P>Thank you for praying for us.  While feeling so difficult to go on, there are comforts and encouragement poured on us from the Lord through many brothers and sisters and friends.</P>

<P>Tomorrow is first day of school for three girls.  Priscilla wondered if she could use Lydia’s school bag since her own bag is too small.  Mom cleaned up Lydia’s bag, again, with too many tears dropped on Lydia’s works, books, and papers.  Oh, Lydia we miss you so much.  We know you are with the Lord (and many reminded us that Lydia is very happy now), but that does not stop us to miss you.</P>

<P>&quot;Why God created Lydia with so much talents, good faith, so determined, so strong, and so smart, but did not use her to serve Him.&quot; Mom mentioned to Esther.</P>
<P>&quot;For this.  If without these characters of Lydia, no one could go through this with such a great testimony.&quot;  Esther answered.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you know where Lydia is now?&quot; Mom asked Priscilla.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are you sad?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, yes and no.&quot;</P>

<P>We thank God for watching three sisters, especially Priscilla.  She lost her buddy sister.  She always played with Lydia (Lydia took very good care of Priscilla for years.  She even taught her math on the hospital bed recently), and nobody is sharing bunk bed with her now.</P>

<P>&quot;I must be very selfish.  Even with so much suffering for Lydia.  I still hope she could be still around us.&quot;  Mom said.</P>
<P>Yeah, Lydia was always graceful even under the extreme pain, suffering, and discomfort.  She often said &quot;Sorry&quot;  &quot;Thank you&quot; during her illness.  We thought she could continue fighting, not knowing it’s way too much for Lydia to bear.</P>
<P>But God knows.  He thinks it’s enough.  Enough is enough.</P>
<P>Now it’s my job to share Lydia’s story to the world.</P>
<P>I pray that God continue to use Lydia’s story for His kingdom.  And this was also the hope and faith that kept Lydia going for last six months…</P>
<P>TO LIVE FOR GOD…</P>
