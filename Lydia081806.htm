</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>It’s another tearful day for us. Our mind, heart, and body are aching terribly. The sorrow was too bad. However, it did get relieved a bit with the comforts sent by God through many people in many different ways.</P>
<P>Lydia is somewhat more awake today, still with a lot of agitation, discomfort, and suffering with moaning.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, we had a meeting (initiated by the hospital) with a group of the doctors and medical staffs. They mentioned they were unable to treat Lydia using the traditional treatments (all failed). They would like to know how they could better serve us while we are here.</P>
<P>We voiced out the frustration with the attitude of some staffs treating Lydia as a dying patient both verbally and in action. Although they did it nicely, we felt very uncomfortable and discouraged in order to go forward.</P>
<P>We told them we understood Lydia is in the final stage. (In their opinion, it’s the end.) We were not denying it. We just didn’t want to be reminded again and again. It’s very discouraging.</P>
<P>I told them no matter what they think. I still have a strong hope and faith that Lydia will get well. Don’t ask me why, I just do. And, not only me and my wife, most importantly, it’s Lydia, that she believes God will heal her. Despite all the suffering and discomfort, her will and determination to get well have been very strong and never changed. Right now, although she could not speak because of the cancer, I know what she wanted - continue fighting the disease.</P>
<P>I asked for a hopeful and optimistic environment for us. They all agreed.</P>
<P>We have agreed to stop the current chemotherapy for a while. Since we do not see its objective effectiveness. The hospital will provide good nutrition to her, through IV and tube feeding. Really, recall last several months, Lydia did not have good nutrition, since she was not able to eat, and NJ tube feeding was never good enough, because of her belly pain. Her blood counts maybe OK, but that was usually boosted by blood transfusion or medicine, not generated by herself. Now, hopefully, with better nutrition and immune system (we are taking some herbal supplements checked with the hospital), her body (created by God) would be able to win over the cancer.</P>
<P>Lydia seemed to have more interactions with us today. However, her left arm has been constantly moving up and down by itself, another neurological problem according to the doctor.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Dear pray worriers, brothers and sisters, and friends,</P>
<P>Lydia has faith she will get well. She continued saying that until she lost the ability to talk two days ago. Let’s have the faith and hope like hers and ask God to heal Lydia, stop the cancer spread and reverse the damage. Lydia needs our sincerely faithful prayers. Let’s join her to fight, and defeat this terrible disease.</P>
<P>May God’s name be glorified.</P></FONT></BODY>
