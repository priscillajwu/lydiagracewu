</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Today was scheduled third chemotherapy.  However…</P>
<P>We went to the hospital again expressed to the doctor our concern why Lydia’s physical conditions deteriorate so much in recent two weeks.  She could not stand or walk normally, vomit several times a day, suffer terrible headache.  Since yesterday, she was not able to hold water in her mouth using her lips.  (And we were in the hospital three days last week.  None of the doctors could figure out what’s wrong, and only diagnosed that she was having a lot of stress.)</P>
<P>After the doctor examined her, he ordered the MRI.  Today’s MRI was only 19 days after last MRI which showed everything was fine, and only 6 days after last CT scan which also did not show any abnormality (although we understood that CT scan tends to miss things).</P>
<P>The MRI results showed terribly bad news.  The tumors recurred. Quite a few tumors spread out in her brain, which were not seen in last MRI 19 days ago. So it’s a very fast type grow back cancer cell. It happened only last couple weeks (apparently, unless last MRI was just a joke). That probably explained why Lydia has been having so much headache and vomiting and so severely. It’s not because of the stress.  Poor little Lydia, she was really in pain, real pain.  (I cried writing this sentence.)</P>

<P>A rapid and timely decision needs to be made. Please pray for the wisdom of the doctors to make right choice of treatments. </P>
<P>Please pray for us. We are in deep shock and sorrow. </P>
<P>Please share with your prayer partner to pray for us. </P>
<P>God has saved us, God will continue deliver us. Please have faith and pray for us. </P>
<P>Please pray for spinal MRI tomorrow morning.</P>
<P>Again, I believe everything is in God’s hand.  He is the best doctor.</P>
<P>Please pray for us so we have strength to face tomorrow…</P>
