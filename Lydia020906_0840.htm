<BR>
Pastor Wu's wife just saw Lydia. 8:10pm<BR>
<BR>
She is awake. All responses(speech, pain) normal. They are going to do some tests to double check the operation result. But brothers Bobby reported the operation was succesful.<BR>
<BR>
Let's keep on praying for complete healing. And also for Lydia to have strength, comfort. Please keep her in your prayers throughout the night, whether you sign up for the 24 hr. prayer or not. Especially for her to be able to have a good night rest.<BR>
<BR>
May the Lord's name be glorified through the people He love, especially our Lydia.<BR>
<BR>
God bless you all,<BR>
<BR>
Yuli<BR>
