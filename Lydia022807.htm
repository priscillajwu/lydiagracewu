Wednesday<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Dear
Friends,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
color:black'>As you probably know, my little sister Lydia was diagnosed with a
malignant brain tumor, cancer, on February 6, 2006. She fought against the
disease for about 6 and a half months. However, what set her apart from another
cancer patient was her undying faith in her God to save her, and never ending
hope and lasting love for those around her. One example of this was when my
birthday rolled around last year. She was in the hospital, but she desperately
wanted to get out. Why? Because she wanted to get me a birthday present. And as
things often are when she sets her mind to do them, she did it. Lydia did get
me a birthday present and even attended my surprise birthday party.<br>
<br>
Last May was my first time participating in Relay for Life. Lydia walked the
survivor lap amid much cheering. Then came the luminaria ceremony. There were
41 lit paper bags that said in honor of Lydia Wu. This made her so happy. She
ran <a href="100_8584.JPG">next to them</a>, checking them, and smiling. Seeing
those bags inspired and encouraged her. And I am so glad that she was able to
see them with her own eyes at least once. <br>
<br>
Although she passed away this past August 21, 2006, she has not left us. I know
that if we put up those luminaria this year, she will see them, and she'll
smile again. I miss her so very much, and this is one thing I want to do for
her. The Luminaria were so special to her, so this year I am chairing the Luminaria
committee and am taking a big role in planning this year's Relay, which also
happens to be at my school. <br>
<br>
I want to invite you to show your support in the ongoing fight against cancer
by joining us for this year’s event. Please click on the link at the bottom of
this email for more information, including details on the inspirational
Survivors’ Lap and the Luminaria Ceremony. I hope to see you there! Also, will
you please visit the site and make a donation to support efforts to find a cure
for cancer? And maybe one day, we will find a cancer cure, and there will be no
more suffering from this disease that took Lydia's life.<br>
<br>
I would suggest making your donation directly toward the Luminaria I mentioned
earlier, when you make your donation. Donating your money to Luminaria still is
a donation, and plus there will be a bag remembering Lydia. After you enter the
amount you would like to donate on my webpage, and click continue, there are
two circles at the top of the screen that will give you the option of &quot;Regular
donation&quot; or &quot;Luminaria donation&quot;. If you select Luminaria
donation and write Lydia's name, a Luminaria bag will be made in her memory.
Let's see if we can get as many luminarias as last year!<br>
