</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Since several days ago, Lydia has been asking Mom (she dared not ask me) to bring them this weekend to Build-A-Bear for Priscilla’s birthday present.  For whatever reason, Lydia already had quite a few Build-A-Bear dolls.  But Priscilla has none.  So, for years, Priscilla had to borrow from Lydia if she wanted to play.</P>
<P>Today, the last day Lydia would feel good physically, before she returns to the hospital tomorrow for the second chemotherapy.  We went to the store, and told Priscilla she could have one doll built.  (All of these plans were kept secretly from Priscilla.)  Priscilla really got surprised and was very happy that Lydia had suggested this.  She got big smile on her face all afternoon.  Lydia and two older sisters also split the cost for this gift to Priscilla.  </P>
<P>I was pretty much only the driver and photographer during the trip.   However, I’ve enjoyed watching the love and happiness among the sisters.</P>
<P>Four girls went home with a cute teddy bear nicely decorated and held tightly by Priscilla.  It’s not a bad idea to enjoy the day right before the chemotherapy.</P>
<P>Thank the Lord.</P>
