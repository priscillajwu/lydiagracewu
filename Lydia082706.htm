</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>In the morning, mom looked into the closet of Lydia and Priscilla (they shared the same closet), trying to find a Sunday worship dress for Priscilla. However, Lydia’s clothes made mom cry. She cried terribly. I noticed and had to drag her to the master bedroom and close the door. We both wept inside for almost an hour. We talked and tried to figure out what had happened. All of these, still quite unreal to us. Still like a nightmare. We hoped we could wake up from it…</P>
<P>We have missed Sunday worships twice in a row, due to 24 hours care for Lydia in the hospital last two Sundays. It’s good to fellowship with brothers and sisters again. Worshipping God felt great. However, talking and sharing after worship was still difficult. My preferred way is just greet each other. Do not say too much to us, unless I start it myself.</P>
<P>Grandparents (mom’s parents) left for Taiwan today. Dad’s sister and her daughter also left for California today. All of sudden, it’s a lot quieter. The worst, without Lydia, this house is definitely too quiet.</P>
<P>Our church summer musical performance was held today (rescheduled from yesterday, due to Lydia’s funeral service). Usually, mom was the producer of the play every year. This year, Esther pretty much took over the majority of the program. The performance was great. However, without Lydia in it, I was continuously thinking of her the entire night. At the end of show, a slide showing "in the memory of Lydia Grace Wu" "We all miss you", and next slide was Lydia’s famous smile picture. That made our eyes very watery.</P>
<P>Many asked why this terrible thing happened to us (we fear God and do our best to serve Him)? Why God did not hear our prayers and heal Lydia for many had fast and prayed around the world for Lydia?</P>
<P>My answer to the first question is why not. Lydia has answered that question very early on. She knew she was the chosen one.</P>
<P>The answer to the second one could be many. However, I believe God does not make mistake. It’s our job to fast and pray. And we have to trust in God that He meant the best for us.</P>
<P>Having said that, we are still grieving terribly. Having faith and hope does help greatly. Many words of comfort and encouragement through email and cards from you also helped us tremendously. </P>
<P>Thank you for hundreds of email sent to us about your thoughts and sharing about Lydia. They were great comfort. Praise the Lord. Sorry we were not able to reply (it was too many), but please know that we have received them and we treasured them very very much.</P>
<P>Please share with us what you experienced in Lydia’s farewell celebration party. </P>
