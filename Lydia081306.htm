</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Around 4 AM this morning, Lydia threw up with the very dark color liquid, later confirmed it’s bleeding from her stomach.</P>
<P>Lydia really did not do well today. Actually, pretty bad. She has further lost strength of her both legs. She always had trouble of numbness on her right leg (started after first brain surgery). Now her left leg started to feel numb.</P>
<P>Lydia also slept a lot and was very drowsy. Not because of the side effects of medicines (they did not give her any medicine which would cause drowsiness, in order to closely check her neurological awareness). That is another sign of getting worse of the tumor damage.</P>
<P>Lydia’s doctor talked to us this afternoon, that he really did not see any improvement from Lydia of this new chemotherapy, and we continued losing ground day after day. He does not want to try any more treatment which we don’t know would be working or not, and it surely will further degrade her quality of life and increase her suffering. He also said we could choose to go home if we think it’s essential for Lydia to stay at home.</P>
<P>Apparently, he does not have much hope or confidence of what’s coming.</P>
<P>"Let’s continue the current treatment." I told him, "we will continue praying for God’s healing." The doctor did not say anything.</P>
<P>Our spirits sank to the bottom many times today, after talked with doctors, seeing Lydia’s tremendous trouble to survive, and her terrible sufferings.</P>
<P>Our spirits also got raised several times today through quite a few prayer worriers visited us today. The prayers, the hope from holy spirits, the love in Christ, the crying for God’s healing lifted up our spirits.</P>
<P>How about Lydia, she is still up there. She said her recovery is going to be long and hard. In the evening, her right leg moved once by herself, all of us were overjoyed (she has not been able to move her right leg for a couple of days now, she either need mom or dad’s help or she has to move using her own hands).</P>
<P>"I know Lord Jesus is going to help me." She was so happy, "I will get well. It’s so obvious."</P>
<P>"But if not, it’s OK." She continued.</P>
<P>Do you know how many tears we shed after hearing her said that? Oh, Lord, please have mercy and grace on us. We are on the verge of breakage.</P>
<P>Please pray for Lydia. Everyday is so critical now, actually every hour. We prayer for upward trend next day, not downward.</P>
<P>This cancer recurrence is like an attack. Like stroke, like heart attach, her conditions just deteriorated too fast. (Only a week ago, we were celebrating her 10th years old birthday at home. And only two weeks ago, she was in swimming competition.)</P>
<P>Many relatives, brothers and sisters, and friends, have been fasting and praying for us. Thank you so much.</P>
<P>If God gives you burden, please fast and pray for Lydia. We sincerely appreciate it.</P>
<P>I have cried so much last few days. We knelt down and beg for God’s healing come to us…PLEASE, LORD JESUS… SHINE YOU LIGHT UPON US…HAVE MERCY ON US…</P></FONT></BODY>
