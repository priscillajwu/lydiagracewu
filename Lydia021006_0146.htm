<BR>
First of all, sorry for sending this note this late.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you SO MUCH for your prayers, encouragement, words/emails of comforts, and willing to do anything to help us. It means so much to us. No earthly words can describe my family's appreciation. I thank God for great people like you surrounded our family at this trial time. I have mentioned to Lydia that many uncles and aunts from daddy's work place are praying for her and care so much about her. She listened and nodded and smiled.<BR>
<BR>
Yesterday was truly longest day of my life. During the waiting, too many worries/strange thoughts kept coming into my mind... what if the tumor was not operable, what if tumor was so engaged with normal brain cells, what if something wrong happened during operation, what if Lydia would not be able to speak and walk afterwards, what if we lose her in the operation room .............. <BR>
I had to keep praying to have peace in my mind.<BR>
<BR>
After 11 hours of waiting outside of operation room, we were finally able to meet the surgeon around 6:30PM. He said to us the operation was successful, he did his best to remove most if not all of the tumor inside. I thanked him a lot. Quite a good job for such a long operation. We got to see Lydia around 8 PM. She was awake. Her face was very swollen, (believe me, she is cutest girl in the world at that moment). We were so happy to see her. She was trying to open her eyes, talk (although not quite clear) and complained greatly about her pain.<BR>
<BR>
It may take some time for Lydia simply to recover from surgery. From the pathological results, it was malignant tumor. Further treatments may be needed in the near future. But we are determined to fight the disease.<BR>
With your prayer and love and care, and God's grace, everything will be OK. I honestly believe it.<BR>
<BR>
May God bless you all<BR>
<BR>
Simon</P>
