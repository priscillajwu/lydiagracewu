</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Finally, after Lydia has been asking for so many times, we decided to take Lydia to the movie. I brought Lydia and Priscilla to the theater early in the morning, hoping there aren’t too many people. I am surprised they were open this early, and it was pretty empty. I’ve never gone to the movie in the morning myself. It’s kind of weird. However, both girls had good time and liked the movie "Cars". I did not enjoy as much as them. It’s probably because I continuously checked Lydia to make sure she was doing OK.</P>
<P>Well, although life goes on, and we tried to keep things as normal as possible, but something has become quite different…</P>
<P>Lydia has gotten more used to be in the public with the feeding tube attached on her face, and sometimes even without her hat. Usually, that would extract a lot of people’s attention. Some would stare at her, and some would even get their party to take a special look of Lydia. Some did not show anything abnormal (that was nice). Little kids were more troubled, and some even got scared. We thank God that Lydia feels more comfortable now.</P>
<P>There are fortunate and unfortunate. I believe God has good plan for all of these. The faith and hope have kept us going.</P>
<P>May God’s name be praised.</P></FONT></BODY>
