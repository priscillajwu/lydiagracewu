</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Lydia continued feeling pretty good these two days.  Just as the doctors told us that she would be doing the best right before each chemotherapy treatment. </P>
<P>She did many things today.  She went to music lesson and visited a family friend.  At their house, she ate the most she’s ever eaten since the first chemotherapy.  She ate more than half of a hot dog, couple slices of peaches, and several chips. It’s still not a lot, but already the most she has eaten within the recent month.  She also </FONT><A HREF="100_9764.JPG"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>played tennis</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4> for at least 10 minutes.  We were really happy to see that.  She has been too weak to play tennis after her first chemotherapy last month.</P>

<P>I joked with Lydia that she is like a battery rechargeable person.  Every evening, we hook her up with the pump (which connects to the electrical outlet) and a bag of nutrition formula.  Then, the next day, she would have the energy to move around, without even having to eat anything from her mouth.</P>

<P>Although happy that Lydia is doing fine, when Mom thinks about the next chemotherapy coming in two days, Mom is very troubled and stressed.  The first chemotherapy treatment was so difficult.  It really scared us quite a bit.</P>
<P>We pray that God would be with us like always.  We ask for the good spirit and enough strength from the Lord.</P>
<P>Thank you very much for praying for us.</P>
