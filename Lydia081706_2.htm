<P>A Prayer… </P>
<I>
<P>&quot;I’m falling on my knees…Jesus You’re all this heart is living for…&quot;</I> Oh God, please listen to my prayer. I beg and plead of you, oh Heavenly Father, please. Just let Lydia wake up. God, please heal her…oh God, You are the God of the <B>Broken</B> and the Friend of the <B>Weak</B>, and we are broken and weak, kneeling before You, pleading on behalf of Lydia. Oh God, please Father…</P>
<P>After arriving at the hospital tonight, I have spent a few hours by Lydia’s bedside just begging her to wake up. Even after my other sisters left, I sat by Lydia hoping to see some sort of life. I rubbed her body from head to foot with a wet paper towel, shifted her in her bed every minute, and held her hand, squeezing it. &quot;Lydia, c’mon girl! I know you’re in there somewhere! Can you open your eyes and look at me? It’s Esther, remember? I love you! Squeeze my hand if you can hear me.&quot; For two hours, I sat by her bed encouraging her and begging her to wake up.</P>
<P>A Worship CD was playing and I sang song after song. Sometimes I felt as though I even saw some response. Her eyes flickered a couple times, and sometimes it almost seemed as though she was listening to the music. Lydia’s agitated movements, shuffling around, and pulling on her many tubes would stop temporarily. My constant stream of words was rejuvenated with this glimpses of hope that maybe she would wake up. She would even raise her hands and put them around me, or in my hand. I often felt like she was just on the surface. Just there on the border of consciousness. So I kept on singing, sometimes putting my head on her bed, and just crying, and pleading out loud to God, and at the same time trying to coax Lydia to wake up. My heart was just torn, and I sat just praying, pleading, and singing. </P>
<P>But despite my best efforts, she never really came around. </P>

<P>My God, my Father…Please…it’s not fair. It’s not right. God, I know You never promised that life would be fair. But God, I know it must hurt you so much to see your children in pain, your children dying of grief and disease. God, no child should have to see her parents, mom and dad, sobbing uncontrollably. No teenager should have to see every member of her family just absolutely torn apart. No girl should have to see her beloved sister dying before her very eyes, and not be able to do anything about it. Oh God! I cry out to you with everything I have left in me, please heal Lydia. Please just put Your healing touch upon my little sister. Just take her into Your arms and let Your Holy Spirit just flow through her</P>

<P>Thank you all for your prayers, please pray that God will give us the faith we need to ask for Lydia’s healing with full conviction that Jesus will save her. We no longer can do anything. Only God has the power, the power to heal and to save. Let us kneel before God, fall upon our knees and cry out, &quot;Oh God, only You can do miracles! God, we ask for a miracle, we ask for a healing, we ask You to save a beautiful, wonderful, and faith-filled young girl who loves You and who wants to serve You! God, our Precious Father, You are the Healer! Let us see Your amazing healing power in Lydia…&quot;</P></FONT></BODY>
