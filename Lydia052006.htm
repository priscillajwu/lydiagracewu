<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P>May 20, 2006, Saturday</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>I decided to wash the cars today. It has not been washed since Lydia got sick, it was so messy inside and outside of the cars.</P>
<P>Deborah, Lydia, and Priscilla got really excited about it. "Wash cars !" They almost changed into the swimsuit for it. (Well, it’s still too cold today.)</P>
<P>Well, I told them there were a lot of pre-works, need to clean up the driveway first. Then, vacuum inside the car, and finally, wash the car. They thought they could just turn on the water right away.</P>
<P>In the middle of sweeping the driveway, Priscilla quit and went inside to take Saturday afternoon nap. In the early stage of vacuum work, Deborah quit also and went to take nap. Lydia was the only one stayed there from beginning to the end. I felt bad for her, and asked her several times if she wanted to get inside and rest. "No, I am OK." she said.</P>
<P>So, Lydia helped sweeping the driveway, picked up messes in the car, and finally, got the water hose, and had the fun part, spray water on the cars and wiped them with soap soaked sponge…. (Deborah did come back for the water part.)</P>
<P>I wondered why Lydia was able to stick to it. That’s it. She appreciated every opportunity to help, even it’s hard work. Life is precious. Time is short. I am sure it’s clear in her young mind.</P>
<P>Often, Lydia felt nauseous and could not eat. Sometimes, she would eat unconsciously while doing something else. Tonight, while Lydia was playing Games, Mom handed over the high nutrition drink to Priscilla, and she held it up for Lydia. </FONT><A HREF="100_8617.JPG"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>The image</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4> was so interesting and touching.</P>
<P>We continue praying for Lydia 7<SUP>th</SUP> MRI coming Monday.</P></FONT></BODY>
