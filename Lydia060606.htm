<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>“Nice,
Lydia! You got a strike! Awesome…” Lydia’s eyes showed happiness and glee as
she spent the morning bowling with her fellow 4<sup>th</sup> graders on their
last day of school. Despite everything that she’s been going through, she was
adamant about attending the last day of school. Since I didn’t need to go to
school, I was her personal bodyguard throughout the entire day. Not only did
she want to go bowling; she wanted to ride the bus.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>“I haven’t ridden the bus in
a long time!” she pleaded. The hot, confined space made me nervous, but she
insisted. I sat with her on the bus, as my mom followed the buses in the car.
As soon as she joined her friends, they drew her back into their conversations
as if there was nothing different. Within seconds they were telling her
problems that were going on and the newest pieces of information about the 4<sup>th</sup>
graders. I smiled broadly as I looked on. Often the bus got quite loud and
chaotic. When this happened, Lydia would lay her head on my shoulder, and I
would put my head on hers, and we’d rest for a little bit. I thanked God for
every intimate moment I was able to spend with my little sister. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>At first Lydia had a lot of
trouble bowling. She couldn’t throw the ball very hard. My mom and I kept
encouraging her, however. Soon after she started, she got a spare! All of her
friends screamed and cheered loudly. I gave her a huge hug. Then, she got a
strike! I was so proud of her. I made sure to take tons of pictures. Later on,
back at school, the 4<sup>th</sup> graders had a pizza party and ordered ice
cream from the ice cream truck. Mom tried to convince her to go home, but Lydia
would not leave school until the end of the day. She said goodbye to her loving
teacher, her best friends and kind classmates. The day, although tiring, was so
much fun, and I was so glad that Lydia had a chance to be a normal 4<sup>th</sup>
grader, having fun, and socializing with friends, for just one day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

hours after we got home, it was time to head out again. Our summer swim team
was having its first swim meet of the season! And Lydia was going to swim! Many
of the members of the swim team asked if Lydia had decided not to attend the
meet. Imagine their surprise as I proudly told them that Lydia was here at the
meet. Not only did she want to swim; she didn’t want to miss a single one of
her sisters’ events, or for that matter, any events. I got a chair for her, and
put it right by the pool. Lydia had me sit down, and she sat on my lap, and
wouldn’t let me leave. Since being diagnosed, Lydia has been so much more
affectionate, and wanting and giving hugs. I loved being close to her and held
her and enjoyed the night, as we waited for Lydia’s event. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>“Event
47! Girls’ 9-10 50 meter breast stroke! Step up!” I waited anxiously by the
blocks as Lydia got into the pool and started swimming. I screamed and cheered
at the top of my lungs as I watched my sister put her heart and everything into
swimming those two laps, and she finished strong. She was barely able to climb
out of the pool and she was panting heavily. I began crying and hugged her.
Lydia, who had feared that she’d never be able to swim again had just competed
in a swim meet, and sprinted two whole laps! I was infinitely proud and so
amazed. Praise God for what He has done for Lydia! It is truly a miracle what
she is able to do. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Indeed, today truly was a
day of wonders, and I thank God that I was there to witness every moment of it.
Every moment of success and pride that God has given to my determined,
courageous, and above all, loving little sister. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
