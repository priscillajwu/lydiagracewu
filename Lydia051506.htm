<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Last night, making sure she will wake up in the morning on time, Lydia prepared two alarm o’clock sets (although Mom would wake her up, but this is Lydia, always so determined). </P>
<P>She wanted to go to school today. However, she woke up this morning not feeling well, and actually got a high fever. This is really the first time since Feb. 6. During her two surgeries and radiation treatments, she never had any fever. </P>
<P>Mom gave her Advil and kept watching her. The fever never really got away for the entire day, slightly lower when under the medication.</P>
<P>Mom called the doctor in the afternoon. He wants us continue observing her closely. Check back with him first thing tomorrow morning.</P>
<P>With regular kids, we probably just stay home and rest, but for Lydia, we weren’t sure. According to her doctor, if she is under chemo therapy, with her temperature today, she needs to be admitted into hospital right away.</P>
<P>Well, maybe over the weekend, Lydia just had too much exposure to the crowd.</P>
<P>Wow, how careful do we need to be, it seems never enough…</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Lydia used her no school day to make little gifts (for others). She enjoyed doing that nowadays. She has been receiving so much love lately. She wants to give. Giving makes her happy. </P>
<P>And for that, I thank the Lord.</P></FONT></BODY>
