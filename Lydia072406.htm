</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>The Children’s Hospital is hosting a summer camp this week for the previous and current cancer patients. We decided to let Lydia visit the camp during the day. Also, a dear auntie invited Lydia’s siblings to go to the Kings Island amusement park. Mom had all of these nicely planned.</P>
<P>Lydia woke up in the morning feeling very sick, and threw up again. She continued feeling terrible, even after all her siblings had left home for the amusement park. Then, she was home with Mom only. She felt pretty bad at that moment.</P>
<P>Thank God a few hours later, she felt a little bit better. Mom took her to the summer camp (about half an hour from home). Upon arriving there, Lydia was happy. She saw some of her doctors and nurses there. Her doctor even gave her a tour in the golf car. Most of the children looked pretty healthy (great to see children survived from cancer), some were like Lydia, seemed still under the treatments.</P>
<P>Lydia was comfortable enough to let Mom leave her alone in the camp. Lydia stayed there for about six hours by herself. This is the longest time without mom or dad nearby (except two brain surgeries, but she was sedated), since she was diagnosed. Mom came home and kept thinking how Lydia was doing for the entire afternoon.</P>
<P>In the evening, we went to take Lydia home. The children were having rock climbing event, one of Lydia’s favorite sports. Of course, Lydia wanted to do it. She used to be a very good rock climber. She was so anxious and was </FONT><A HREF="100_0040.JPG"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>the first to climb</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>. She started, and climbed up for several feet, then stopped. Not able to climb any higher, she clung on to the rock and robe, not willing to give up. Deep in her mind, she was probably very frustrated, or could not believe that she has become so weak. She stayed in the air for a long time, tried again and again, to grab another rock. It was very difficult to watch her struggling. She did not want to let go but she just did not have enough strength…</P>
<P>At the end, she came down, very tired, without smile either. We came home shortly after.</P>
<P>At home, she felt terrible and suffered a great discomfort, and not in the good mood. She said something made mom very sad and angry. Well, mom still took care of her tube feeding, and all the medicines. Mom has to crush the tablets and pills, put in the water, and injected through the feeding tube, Lydia refused (or was too nauseous) to swallow anything.</P>
<P>It’s a Long day for us. We planned and hoped that all the girls could have some fun in the summer. Indeed, they did. It was probably a little too much for Lydia. Well, it’s difficult to have things just right. We should look at the bright side. All of them did have a good time, and so did Lydia, for sure.</P>
<P>And for that we thank God and praise God.</P>
