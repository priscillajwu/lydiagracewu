</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Finally, the doctor said Lydia could go home today.</P>
<P>Right before Mom was going to sign the discharge form, Lydia threw up badly, and the NG tube came out of her stomach.</P>
<P>Now NG tube needed to be re-inserted.  Lydia did not let the nurse do it.  She just did not want it and was very firm this time.</P>
<P>So Lydia and Mom had to stay in the hospital, did not know what to do.  Since NG tube needed to be in place before Lydia could go home.</P>
<P>After a few hours and a lot of struggle (including she tried to eat, but not successful), Lydia unwillingly swallowed another NG tube.</P>
<P>&quot;Can we go home now?&quot;  Lydia said and walked toward the door, right after the tube was inserted.</P>
<P>Everybody was amazed how strong her will was.  </P>
<P>The ride coming home was rough.  The entire evening and night was very difficult.  Almost all of us were attending to her for all her needs.</P>
<P>There were more than a dozen different medications, automatic pump for her feeding to maintain, home care shots to boost her blood count…  So much work, maybe we should just stay in the hospital....</P>
<P>But, home, sweet home.  It’s the best place.  Lydia is definitely much happier home.</P>

<P>Today, Lydia started to cry out, &quot;Daddy, please help me.&quot; When she was in the extreme discomfort.  That was always the most dreadful words to me.  Again and again, I felt I was so weak and powerless.  While we were praying for God’s help, we still need to watch that she could throw up any moment.  We pray that it will get over soon.</P>

<P>Lydia did not forget to make me a father’s day card and gift bag.  So sweet and thoughtful, even while she was so ill.</P></FONT></BODY>
