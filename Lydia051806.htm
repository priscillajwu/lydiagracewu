<p><span style='font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Arial'>May 18, 2006, Thursday<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Thank you for your prayer,
Lydia’s temperature has come down today. Praise the Lord.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia visited school
briefly in the morning, soon not feeling well and had to rush home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Recall that Lydia rarely
missed school since kindergarten. Her attendance at school was perfect. She
very seldom got sick. Rare occasion got fever (probably less than a few times),
she would recover very quickly. But now, only a mild fever, it would take
several days just to get slightly better. Really, everything we have or own is
from God, nothing we can boast about. He gave and He could take away.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>May His name be praised.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(Job 1:21)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia collected a lot of
vegetables from our backyard with mom in the late afternoon. They gave away the
vegetables to the neighbors. She was really excited to do that. To give is
really what Lydia like very much. That makes her very happy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
