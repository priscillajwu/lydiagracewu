</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Lydia has been sleeping since last night (Friday). She was only slightly awake briefly a few times today. Now I am not going to worry about that like couple days ago. God will wake her up later. She may need a lot of sleep to build up her immune system, to recover, and ready to fight.</P>
<P>Lydia’s blood pressure and heart rate started to get really high last night. There were quite some concerns. It stayed high for the entire day. However, she did not show discomfort from it. We need to closely watch it.</P>
<P>Lydia’s oxygen levels also got low many times today. So she has been on the oxygen mask a lot. She needed extra effort to breathe. Watch her striving to breathe made me cry and heart ache.  It’s very difficult to watch, but I need to watch it closely.</P>
<P>Lydia had bladder infection (due to catheter irritation), and ran high fever. The antibiotics did not work well. We just gave her Tylenol. Hope to bring her temperature down.</P>
<P>Lydia started to sweat a lot today. It’s not cold sweat. It seemed to be the body heat. The room temperature was fine. I took that as a good sign that her body is working very hard.</P>
<P>Grandma (dad’s mom) came from Taiwan today to swap with grandparents (mom’s parents are going back to Taiwan). For next few days, Lydia has all her grandparents here to pray for her and cheer her up for continuing fighting. (That was also rare for Lydia. Lydia grew up without grandparents around much. They were usually ten thousand miles away.)</P>
<P>Really, today is still not a GOOD day for Lydia yet. However, we still have faith that our heavenly father will heal Lydia. As one prayer worrier shared, that God will bring her back to us well and whole again.</P>
<P>Tomorrow is Sunday, the Lord’s day. We cast Lydia in the hand of the Lord. May the prayers of the righteous have the great power, and that Lydia will be healed (James 5:16).</P>
