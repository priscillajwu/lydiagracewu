<P>Dear Prayer Warriors,</P>
<P>&#9;Lydia went to her school musical practice this morning. She is a duckling in the Symmes production of Honk Jr., which was originated from The Ugly Duckling. My sisters and I went to see her practice, and we admired the main characters’ singing voices, at their such young age.</P>
<P>&#9;But before the practice was over, Lydia didn’t feel well at all. She came off the stage crying, and said that her stomach hurt, and that she was so frustrated. We then headed for home. At home, she took a nap and we all did miscellaneous things. Lydia also announced that she wanted to go out to dinner to celebrate the end of her radiation.</P>
<P>&#9;So for dinner, we went to the Old Spaghetti Factory by Cincinnati Mills. There were many people there so we waited for about half an hour and watched Lydia and Mom crochet. It was extremely entertaining. Then, we washed our hands, my mom prayed, and we ordered. Amusingly, everyone ordered the same thing except my dad. It was delicious. Afterward, we went outside and drove away.</P>
<P>&#9;On the car, Esther was telling us a funny story and we all laughed. That is, until I noticed that my mouth retainer was missing! I had only had this green retainer since Tuesday and I wasn’t really happy about losing it. My dad kept saying that we would have to dig through the trash can to find it, and I was losing hope. I thought about whom would pay for my new retainer, my parents or me. However, Lydia started saying some words of wisdom that I didn’t know she had inside of her. There she was, sitting by the window, crocheting, and saying that it was no big deal. She said that everyone needs time to get used to new things such as a retainer. But what I was most amazed at was her comment that we shouldn’t let this little incident ruin such a cheerful, fun night. After her many wise comments, the mood in the car lightened up noticeably.</P>
<P>&#9;So we drove back to the restaurant, and my mom, Esther, and I jumped off the car and went back to our table. To my horror, it was set up for new customers. However, my mom asked a nearby waiter who said that she had seen it. I breathed a sigh of relief. Soon the retainer was brought out, and we left.</P>
<P>&#9;So now, I’m typing this letter and looking over everything that happened today. I’m truly grateful for everything; from having such an entertaining night, to finding my precious, and expensive, retainer. Above all, I thank God for giving me such a wonderful family that will say the right thing at the right time, to make everything better.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Sincerely,</P>
