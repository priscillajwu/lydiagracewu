</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>My dear prayer heroes,</P>
<P>It is definitely much better for Lydia to be home. We were able to pray together at home.</P>
<P>This weekend Lydia enjoyed many things with the entire family. We watched a couple of DVDs. Her sisters played with her and spent time around her. It’s a good distraction from her pain.</P>
<P>Lydia is under very heavy dose of many medications (We brought ten prescriptions home on Friday). We pray that the side effects of these medicines will be minimal.</P>
<P>All three sisters started spring break this weekend. However, Lydia’s radiation and doctor appointments continue. We pray that the radiation will start to be effective soon, not only stopping the growth of the tumors, but also starting to shrink them.</P>
<P>Lydia’s throat started to hurt these days. Every chew or swallow could be a challenge. Priscilla (her younger sister) had toothache, and complained about it. Lydia told her, "You will have dentist appointment in two days, then the pain will be gone. My sore throat could last many weeks along with my radiation. So, be patient, only two more days." Lydia has learned to cope with many sufferings. </P>
<P>When Lydia combed her hair, we saw quite a few hairs on her comb and on the floor. So, it’s starting… </P>
<P>In Him,</P>
<P>Simon</P></FONT></BODY>
