</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Lydia continues losing a lot of hair. Her hair dropped all over the house, wherever she goes. A lot of them also fell in her shirts, and that makes her very itchy (on top of the itchness from the side effect of pain medicines). Sometimes, her hair will stick to the food she was eating, or fall into her food plate. It was just very inconvenient. (I will be very frustrated if that happened to me.) She seems to deal with it all right.</P>
<P>Last night, we took turns to comb her hair. So much hair caught in the comb. We collected them into a plastic bag. Priscilla used those hair and made a donut shaped piece (like a bird nest). It became a toy. Quite a piece of art. We all liked it.</P>
<P>"Do you feel sad to see your hair fall?" I asked Lydia.</P>
<P>"That is OK. It will grow back." Lydia answered, "Although it may take several years.&quot;</P>
<P>She is right. To grow back to her current length of hair, it may take a few years. However, I thank the Lord, for He is helping us to get through the process…</P>
<P>Tonight is Friday night, it’s the night I and Lydia got to stay home while everyone else gone to church. She was not feeling well, felt very tired, and had quite a bit of headaches. I picked up the Bible, and read entire chapter of Psalm 119 to her. She liked it a lot. It was very enjoyable. Praise the Lord.</P>
