</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Last two days, after funeral, mom and dad have been to Lydia’s grave many times, mainly to be there alone and cried without being seen by the girls (Priscilla said seeing mom and dad cry made her sad, and she did not like it.)  Today, it was first time for the sisters to visit.  They planted a bunch of red roses.  </P>
<P>Grandparents (mom’s parents) called from Taiwan and asked a lot of questions about the Christian faith.  For years, we tried to convert them (grandpa was atheist, grandma was Buddhist) but with no success.  Because of Lydia, they were touched and were willing to accept Christ only days before Lydia passed away. They were very sad and felt so hopeless during Lydia’s final days.  The experience in Lydia’s funeral service made them think.  They were amazed that we and all of Christian friends were so sure that Lydia is with the Lord now.  Grandma said she has been Buddhist for her entire life.  She tried very hard to be a good person, wishing to be able to get into heaven through her good deeds.  Yet, she was not sure if she could make it.  (We told her many times about this before, but she never took into her heart.)  This time, overwhelmed and saw Lydia’s faith in the first hand.  They were convinced with powerful testimony from Lydia.  We praised the Lord for saving grandparents souls.</P>
<P>Tonight, we were looking for something which only Lydia knew where it is.  We looked and looked, just could not find it.  Again, that made me very sad, and missed Lydia badly.</P>
<P>Processing cards received from the farewell party and through the mail is a lot of work for mommy.  But at least there are a lot of comfort and encouragement from the brothers and sisters and friends.</P>
<P>However, the hospital bills also kept coming.  Processing those was extremely hard and hurting…</P>
<P>Thank you for your prayers for us.  Mom and dad had peace today and felt the blessings of the prayers of many saints.</P>
