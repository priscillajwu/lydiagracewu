</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Thank you so much for coming to visit today.  Sorry for the long waiting line.</P>
<P>We were entirely embraced by your prayers, love, comfort, and support.  Thank God for holding us up today.  I’ve tried not to cry.  However, both mom and I cried the entire night.  Could not help.  Each hug, each handshake warmed up our hearts greatly.</P>
<P>We were truly comforted by your presence.  The love of Christ Jesus has been within all of us.</P>
<P>We praise God that many shared with us that they were encouraged and inspired by Lydia’s faith while following the journey with Lydia.  Many shared their relationship with God have gotten closer while praying for her for the past six months.  Quite a few expressed that they were converted and accepted Lord Jesus while reading Lydia’s story about how God has done amazing grace for Lydia.</P>
<P>Many Lydia’s friends came today to see her for the last time.  We encouraged these ten years old children to keep up with the good faith.  We shall meet Lydia again in the Lord.</P>
<P>Many have asked how they can help.  Please share Lydia’s story to the people around you.  May God’s name be glorified.</P>
<P>&quot;And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.&quot;  (Romans 8:28)</P>

<P>Thank you for dressing red today.  It’s Lydia’s favorite color.  Please wear red tomorrow.  Let’s celebrate that Lydia is now with the Lord with the crown of righteousness.  (2 Timothy 4:8)</P>
