<BR>
watched Lydia getting into car and going home at about 7:00pm. she walked by herself,<BR>
how great our God is! <BR>
<BR>
trust that our Lord will show His grace, strength, and glory in her future medical<BR>
treatments<BR>
<BR>
docs specifically remind them: stay away from people who have fever, cold, flu, <BR>
or any other illness because she can't afford it. i hate to say this, but i should:<BR>
try to minimize your visitation, please do not visit Lydia if you have any illness.<BR>
<BR>
keep on praying for her and her family<BR>
<BR>
Only Glory to God<BR>
<BR>
