</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>The thunderstorm early in the morning and a cloudy day did not help clear up our mind.</P>
<P>We returned Lydia’s cello back to the music instruments store today.  (We have been renting the cello for her since we needed to change the size of cello as she grew taller.)  It was not a pleasant experience.  I guess most of people who returned the rental instruments because their kids decided to quit.  But not us, Lydia wanted to continue playing cello.  She always wanted.  I told them Lydia passed away last week.  A young lady there was speechless and quickly disappeared (I guess she did not know what to say or handle it).  An older man heard and said he was very sorry.  We took off.  It was raining outside.  Our hearts were heavy.</P>
<P>&quot;We felt sad because Lydia could not continue playing cello, piano, tennis, swimming, going to school, having fun like her sisters or her friends…&quot; Mom said to me in a sad tone.</P>
<P>&quot;How do we know she is not?  Maybe she is.  If not, then there must be something better for her to do.&quot;  I said, &quot;What I troubled is that Lydia may not be quite used to the environment without mommy and daddy.&quot; I remembered Lydia got lost once in the Disney world theme park.  She was extremely scared.</P>
<P>&quot;However, I believe Lord Jesus could take care of that part.&quot;  I continued, &quot;Our God can do a much better job in heaven than we as the parents can do on earth.&quot;</P>

<P>I read a few little books to help relieving the grieving of the loss of the child.  One of them boldly suggested that our children in heaven probably continue grow up, because there are work in heaven, like worshipping God.</P>
<P>It’s a good thought.  However, again I have to believe our heavenly father will take care of that part also, in a way better than I could imagine.</P>

<P>&quot;Do you miss Lydia?&quot;  Mom asked Priscilla again today.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are you sad?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes and no, she is in a much better place.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you rather go there or stay here?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I rather go there.  It’s better.&quot;  Priscilla said it pretty certainly.</P>
<P>Mom was surprised of Priscilla’s answer.</P>

<P>In a separate occasion, mom asked Deborah the same question.</P>
<P>&quot;She is in the paradise.  Of course, it’s a better place.  I miss her, but I am happy for her.&quot;  Deborah said, &quot;I would like to be in the paradise too.&quot;</P>

<P>We were happy for their pure faith.  Thank God for helping them to cope.  For we know many (so many) are praying for us.</P>
<P>We continued receiving a lot of emails, cards, phone calls of comforts.  Thank God for the blessings.</P>

<P>Some people said to me, &quot;You still have three daughters.&quot;  I was not happy to hear that at all.  No matter how many children I have.  One or a dozen.  That makes no difference.  I will not grieve less if I have more children.  Each of my children is more than one hundred percent of my life, not twenty five percent each.  Losing Lydia is like take my entire life away.  The pain is so huge.  More than I could bear.</P>

<P>I was always proud of our family.  We were so close.  The bounding seems so inseparable.  I once thought nobody could break us.  It’s unbreakable.  I was wrong, because God did.  He broke it.</P>

<P>&quot;The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; may the name of the Lord be praised.&quot;  Job 1:21.</P>
<P>I thank God for this verse, from thousands years ago…</P>
