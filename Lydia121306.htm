<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Snowed
on last Thursday! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>I
was stuck in the traffic for more than an hour for taking Deborah to school. It
gave me a lot of time to think of Lydia. The original plan was I would go to
Greene School (which is Lydia’s 5<sup>th</sup> &amp; 6<sup>th</sup> grade school,
if she is still alive) for a books donating morning announcement. It was made
possible by a group of gifted parents. We really appreciate their love for
doing this to the memory of Lydia. On the way to Deborah’s school, the snow
brought me back the memory of Lydia when she was playing with snow in the
Ambulance and making snowman in the hospital room. She was so happy, even her
head was hurting so much. I could still picture her smiling now. She wasn’t
upset for not being able to play snow outside. This was something different.
Not too many people got to play with snow in the Ambulance and on hospital bed.
She enjoyed the happy moment like that; even it was short.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I always encouraged her; “this is just one year
of hardship and suffering, we would be back to normal in no time”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>God
took away her suffering forever, I should be happy for her. But I cried and
cried almost the whole hour to Deborah’s school. I even cried more after I came
home. Up to right now, I still have that SNOW impact on me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Lydia
was a very contented girl. She was always happy not asking much. Most of time,
she did or tried to do was to please parents and please God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Oh!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>God helps us to please you! Make us strong
to witness your love!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>After
dropping off Deborah to her school, I still headed to Lydia’s school; even I
was late for the morning announcement. I took some pictures of books, and I
visited her math class. Because I wanted to see the class picture which teacher
put up with Lydia’s picture pasted on it. To see her smiling picture with the
rest of her classmates was a heartbreaking experience. Math is Lydia’s favorite
subject. She was very good at it. God spared her for no need to learn more
math. Actually, she had done for everything on earth. I thanked her math
teacher for doing this for us! We love her!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Oh!
God helps us to appreciate what we are doing now, and longing to see you face
to face soon!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
