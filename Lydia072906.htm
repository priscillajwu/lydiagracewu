<FONT SIZE=4><P>Dearest friends,</P>

<P>&#9;&quot;Amazing… Wonderful... Incredible…&quot; Yes, indeed. I once used to think that strength and courage primarily characterized heroes like Hercules, the famous Grecian war heroes, and the men on the World’s Strongest Men competitions. But true strength, true courage goes so much deeper, and is so much harder to come by than physical strength.  True strength and courage…</P>
<P>&#9;This morning was the Tri-County Swim League Championships for 9 and 10-year-olds. For many weeks, we had wondered whether Lydia would be able to attend, we could really never be quite sure. However, against all odds, the entire family, including Lydia, headed to championships today. We arrived a little late, and by the time we got to the pool, Lydia was about to go in five minutes. My mom and I anxiously prepared Lydia for her swim, but it was all just going so fast. After a quick prayer, it was time for Lydia to get in. It was too much, and too fast. She screamed as the girl in the neighboring lane jumped into the pool. She was so scared. I bit my lip, holding back tears. She was shaking, and seemed so unwillingly to get in. I gently lowered her into the pool, telling her that </FONT><A HREF="100_0112.JPG"><FONT SIZE=4>she could do it</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>. She started crying and all I could do was pat her arm and say it was ok. Lydia was just so scared, and I couldn’t do anything to help her swim. All I could do was stand back and let the tears run as my little sister </FONT><A HREF="100_0114.JPG"><FONT SIZE=4>started her race</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>. </P>
<P>&#9;The already loud arena became deafening. I watched as coaches from other teams cheered her on. The people in the stands cheered encouragingly. I yelled and cheered and screamed and listened as my mom’s voice broke as she cried. Our team’s coaches were there, all crying and cheering Lydia on. I was dimly aware of the announcer talking about Lydia and what she was going through. </FONT><A HREF="100_0115.JPG"><FONT SIZE=4>She reached the other wall</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>, turned, and started back. And she was still going steady. Despite the exhaustion, Lydia finished her race. As I pulled her out, the place simply erupted. As I looked into the stands, families and parents stood, all cheering. Hundreds of people around the pool all stood and clapped, and screamed. Cheering for this little girl who had displayed that rare true strength, and true courage. Coaches and officials and swimmers from other teams came up to congratulate Lydia on her swim. </P>
<P>&#9;And all I could do was stand in amazement at how loving these complete strangers were. And as I reflect on the day, I’m amazed and grateful for what our loving God did. He made all wonderful people who they are. And He had given Lydia the best encouragement possible: Affirmation from hundreds of people that didn’t even know her that she was displaying true strength and true courage. </P>
<P>&#9;Although Lydia was not able to finish her second race, I was simply grateful that she’d had such an experience. It is a day that will always be imprinted on my memory, and hopefully on hers, too. My dear little sister has shown greater strength and courage than I could ever possibly hope to understand or for that matter, display. Strength and courage to go through what no one should go through, let alone a 9-year-old girl. </P>
<P>&#9;Thank you God, for giving me such a brave little sister. Thank you Lord for supplying her with what she needs to overcome her hardships. Thank you Jesus for giving our family such a wonderful support system of friends. And thank you for being the One who first showed that never-ending strength, so that we may have your strong arms to lean on when the going gets hard. Thank you. </P>

<P>Love, love, love,</P>
