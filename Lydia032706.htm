</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Since it’s spring break for all the sisters, and Lydia had two clinic checkups and radiation treatment today, we took a field trip to Children’s Hospital and Barrett Cancer Center. The sisters got to see what Lydia has been experiencing in seeing doctors, getting radiation treatment, and having long discussions with doctors about her conditions and treatments. Esther was able to understand most of today’s discussion with Lydia’s doctors, while the younger two were a bit bored.</P>
<P>However, when we were in the radiation room, the big radiation machine drew much attention from all of them. With all the sisters surrounding her, Lydia seemed pretty happy, and showed them around in the hospitals.  All the doctors, nurses, and technicians were happy to see all the sisters.  &quot;All girls? Oh, you are out-numbered.&quot; Everybody said to me.  I thank the Lord for the blessings.</P>
<P>The oncologist was still not sure why Lydia has been having severe headaches. This is not typical for her disease. He will try to get another pathology report by a third party.</P>
<P>Lydia was able to eat well and with energy more than usual, although with much pain. I was puzzled. Later, we realized that the increased appetite is also a side effect of steroids. We hope that the steroids dose can be tapered down soon.</P>
<P>In the evening, Lydia went shopping with Mommy for almost two hours. After she came home, she still was not feeling tired. Once again, this was probably as a result of the steroids.</P>
<P>At night, listening to the suggestion of the doctors, Mom tried to have Lydia wait a little longer before taking her pain medication. This made Lydia very uneasy, and she cried really badly. She has been taking the medication very frequently, and she felt comfortable this way. She has a hard time not to take it. Her belly has been bigger than usual (another side effect), and she has been itchy all over her body causing quite a few scars from scratching. We pray that she can decrease the use of the medicine….</P>
