<P>My dear brothers and sisters in Christ, </P>
<P>Many of you already knew that Lydia need another surgery to remove residual tumor left over from last operation. Yes, it's difficult. Actually, very difficult to hear the verdict from the oncologist. But God's grace is sufficient. The peace has given to me from the Lord, as I am writing this email..... </P>
<P>Lydia knew about it right away. She was OK about it. She just hoped it could be done after she has recovered better. </P>
<P>Tomorrow we will be in Children hospital meeting with doctors. Original plan about minor surgery to get chemotherapy ready and radiotherapy will be postponed. </P>
<P>Every year in springtime, we would go to studio and take a family portrait. Lydia hoped that we could do it earlier this year, since she knew she would lose her hair a few weeks into the radiotherapy. So, we did, tonight. We were in JCPenney, with grandma, took the family picture. Everybody had a big smile in the picture. </P>
<P>Something interesting. Since Lydia does not have homework (of course, she has not been to school for quite a while). She will join Deborah doing homework. She would even help Priscilla doing homework. It was so cute, when we saw it (also made my eyes watery). I am sure Lydia would rather to have her own homework to work on. Lydia should have in-home tutor very soon. </P>
<P>Your continuous prayers have been helping us tremendously. I need to let you know that. It's the love of body of Christ. It's so true, and so real. </P>
<P>In Him, </P>
<P>Simon</P></BODY>
