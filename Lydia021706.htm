<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>My dear brothers and sisters in Christ, <BR>
<BR>
This is the first day Lydia was home after staying in Children hospital for 11 days.<BR>
<BR>
She woke up couple times last night because of pain, then took pain medicine. Generally, she had a good night of sleep.<BR>
<BR>
Since she could not go to school, while three sisters gone to school, and daddy gone to work, (a little bored or feeling sad?) she would spend time reading through cards and gifts she received. It seems to bring her comforts, knowing that many friends, uncles and aunts, have been praying for her and care so much about her.<BR>
<BR>
Recall the past 11 days in hospital. I was amazed about her faith in the Lord Jesus. (Most of the children do.) When in serious pain, she would cry out and pray that Lord Jesus help to relieve her pain. (A few times, she did cry out to me, "It's so painful, I can not stand it anymore, daddy, please help me....", I scared of it when she did that. Becaue that broke my heart, and I could do nothing to relieve her pain but holding her hand.) A lot of times, she would want me to pray for her too. Again and again, Lord Jesus gave her enough strength to go through these painful moments.<BR>
<BR>
You may think why don't we use pain medicine. Actually, the side effects of various pain medicines, will cause different kind of discomfort or be harmful to the brain or liver. Dose and duration often did not work right. It was not an easy matter.<BR>
<BR>
Now, I truly realized (of course I knew, but not truly experienced) that the best thing parents can give to our children is to lead them to the Lord. Nobody else, nothing else can help them more effectively, through the most diffcult time in life, either physical or emotional. Please share this with our seeker friends if they happen to know about Lydia.<BR>
<BR>
Please pray for Lydia, she seems not having good appetite.<BR>
Thanks a lot, and God bless.<BR>
<BR>
In Him <BR>
Simon and family </P>
