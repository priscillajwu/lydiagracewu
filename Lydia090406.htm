<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>It’s the Labor day holiday today,
and we stayed home for the entire day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It’s been two weeks since Lydia passed away. It felt like only
yesterday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We tried a little bit to clean
up Lydia’s stuff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was so
difficult.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Our hearts ached and felt so
sad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s like the heart is pressing
the stomach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Both heart and stomach
felt terribly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We had to stop and just
talked about Lydia…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>One thing we felt so frustrated is
that Lydia used to be the person who facilitated the communication in the
family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She could speak and express so
well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When we tried to say something,
after half a sentence, she already got what we wanted to say, and she would
finish the sentence for us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So, some of
us became so lazy in talking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Lydia
simply talked everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She talked so
much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She probably talked more than
everybody else in the family combined.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Quite a few times, I wanted her to shut up, and blamed her that some of
us had lost the ability to effectively communicate because Lydia said it all
for us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She would cry and say sorry and
express that she did not do that on purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>She just could not help.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Actually, most of time, we enjoyed
her wit and often amazed how quick she could talk and how quick she understood
what people trying to say, and the way she said was always so logical.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She could debate so well, that I often did
not have any more to say, because her logic was right, and I had to agree with
her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Now, not only it’s too quiet at
home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We found we had difficulty in the
communication among us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And that got a
lot of tension.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We realized Lydia used
to be facilitator, the mediator of the entire family.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Now, Esther would be the best to do what Lydia used to do.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, she is too old to talk more than
she wanted to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Being so frustrated, I
just missed Lydia so much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Things are
so different without Lydia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Priscilla had to plead somebody to
sleep with her every night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She does
not like to sleep alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mom did it
several times for last couple weeks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>During the Labor day long weekend, she hoped Esther or Deborah could
sleep with her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Esther really did not
like the idea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Deborah spent two nights
with her, and Priscilla was happy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But
it was still not as good, since Deborah fell asleep right away.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Lydia usually would talk to Priscilla until
Priscilla fell asleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Lydia took care
of Priscilla so well, none of us, including mom and dad could do as good job as
Lydia did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>This afternoon, Priscilla wanted
to ride a bike.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She got on Lydia’s
bike, the size was better for Priscilla.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>When Lydia was alive, Priscilla had to ride the smaller one, it’s really
too small for her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now, although
Priscilla got the right size, but nobody was riding with her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So mom did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>And I was fixing the helmet for her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It took me quite some time, I believe Lydia could do that for Priscilla
if she were still alive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Can we not think about Lydia?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was apparently not possible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>When the tension became high today
when we could not communicate well, it just came to us that during Lydia’s
illness, she kept reminding us to be nice to each other.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Back then, we would calm down right away
because she said so, (and she was definitely right).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Now Lydia went to be with the
Lord, we realized how precious she was, and how much we need to improve
ourselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
