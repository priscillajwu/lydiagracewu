<p><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>March
9, 06<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>My dear prayer heroes,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Thank you for your prayer.
Today, Lydia has gone through another surgery, the insertion of the port for
the chemo therapy and spinal fluid sample extraction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>We were told that these two
were pretty simple, and we thought it was something very quick and easy. Well,
it was much less complex, compared with brain surgery, and we came home the
same day. However, she was still under a lot of pain, and suffered some mental
distress where she was in the recovery room with us this evening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia talked to us a lot
while she was trying to recover from anesthesia. A lot of them really made my
heart ache... She was constantly crying and continuous expressing her
discomfort and not feeling well…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;I wish I were a
regular kid, so I don’t have to go through all of these…&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;I feel so bad that
sisters can’t do as much as they want to do because of me...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;I would die if any of
my sister got brain tumor, it causes the family so much…&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;I want the entire brain
radiation treatment. I would give up my left ear hearing. I don’t want to come
back again to endure all of these.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;I would like to have
icy smoothie if I have dry mouth radiation side effect…, but you have already
spent so much money because of me. I feel really bad. You can use my own money
to buy….&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;I feel really bad
that I have more share of food, and sisters were not happy about it….&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Are you mad of me? I
feel like I screwed up something big….&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>I could not remember all of
them. I was surprised that these were all in her little mind. While she was
weak mentally and physically (resulted from the operation and anesthesia
effects?) She would cry and express her feeling. Oh, Lord, please help us and
Lydia. Help her to understand deep inside that it’s not her fault. Lord, use
her life as the witness of your grace and mercy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Earlier today, in the
clinic check up. Many doctors would jam into the small check up room to take a
peek of her. Many were amazed of what she could say. One social worker made a
comment, &quot;Lydia is like a star, everybody wanted to see her…&quot; Oh,
Lord, please use her to glorify your name.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>One thing to mention, we
got into preparation room before noon today, we did not get into operation room
until 4:30 PM. It was a long wait. Many earlier operations have taken longer
time to finish. Also, there was an emergency needed to go before us. We
recalled our own two brain surgeries probably causing people after us waiting
for a long time as well. While we wait, we understood and were not particularly
troubled with the extra long wait. Every sick kid should receive the best care
they could have. We could wait a little bit, since our conditions were not as
bad as others today in the operation rooms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>God is good, all the time.
And may God bless you all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>In Him<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Simon<o:p></o:p></span></p>
