<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P>April 9, 2006, Sunday</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Since Lydia does not have radiation treatment over the weekend, she has not been outside since Friday morning.  Mom and Dad encouraged her to have a short visit to Church Sunday school.  She did not feel well enough to do it (she did throw up Sunday morning).</P>
<P>So, Lydia stayed home for the entire weekend.  She did a lot of reading about her research project for school, whenever she felt good enough.</P>
<P>Today, Mom and Lydia ordered some prayer bears from Internet.  Lydia would like to give them to other sick children in the hospital, and tell them that God loves them.</P>
<P>She also likes the idea to raise the funding for cancer research.  To her, this is very important since it can help others.  She has donated some monetary gifts received from Daddy’s work place to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.  Esther is also doing the fund raising for American Cancer Society in honor of Lydia.  All of these arrangements made Lydia happy.  Yes, it’s the right things to do.  It’s God’s love.</P>
<P>Praise the Lord.</P>
