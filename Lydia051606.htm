<FONT SIZE=4><P>This morning Lydia woke up and felt better, and fever seems gone for the most of it.</P>
<P>Mom still called the doctor as was told yesterday.  The doctor still wanted us to go to hospital.  We were kind of reluctant, well, to be a good patient, we went anyway.  Although Lydia’s temperature was OK in the morning, and preliminary blood test did not show anything wrong, to be cautious, Lydia was injected with a high dose antibiotics.  That took several hours.  By the time Lydia got home, it was late afternoon already.</P>
<P>Lydia was worried about her progress of school work, she did not want to get behind.  (She caught up quite a bit recently.)  This fever slowed her down again.  She cried about it.  I told her not to worry about it.  But you could see the sadness in her eyes.</P>
<P>The blood count was also tested.  The white blood cell has increased to 3.4 units (from 2.3 just 5 days ago).  Praise the Lord.</P>
<P>At night, Lydia’s fever came back again (after being OK for entire day).  We were puzzled.  We were instructed not to give her any Advil, only Tylenol.  So, we gave her some, and called the doctor again.  Well, this time, since her blood count is higher.  We were allowed to stay home and continue to observe.</P>
<P>We were warned again that if this were during chemo treatment, she would be admitted to hospital right away.</P>
<P>Well, well, enough stress already.  Please pray for Lydia.  She had a lot of headaches these two days than last couple weeks.  </P>
<P>Need to cast everything in God’s hand.  We also pray for the faith in Him and peaceful mind...</P>
