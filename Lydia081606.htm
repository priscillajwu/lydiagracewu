</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Lydia continues fighting the disease with her faith of the Lord Jesus.</P>
<P>Although she is now severely brain and spinal cord damaged by the fast growing tumor in just a week, she still kept praying, &quot;Lord Jesus, please help me.&quot; (Whenever she is awake, day or night).  She would not give up, and would not let go, either.</P>
<P>I stepped away for a couple of hours.  Mom told me Lydia woke up and was looking for me, &quot;Where is daddy, I want daddy.&quot;  Mom said to Lydia, &quot;Daddy is not here, but mommy is here.&quot;  However, Lydia seemed not able to recognize mommy.  </P>
<P>Oh, God, this was tremendous tragedy to mom and daddy.  I cried with mom badly when she told me that.  Mom cried too many times today for this big change for Lydia.</P>
<P>Later, Lydia seemed not able to communicate with us.  It’s harder to tell what she tried to say.</P>
<P>Since not able to say if she needs to go to bathroom, and we made her tried several times, and did not get urine out.  Unfortunately, she has to have catheter (bladder tube) inserted.  That caused her a lot of discomfort.</P>
<P>Later today, Lydia started long sleep, hardly awake.  That was very bad.</P>
<P>In the evening, Lydia woke up a few times very briefly, and only said, (sounded like) &quot;Help.&quot;  Like she has been doing, we believe she continue crying for God’s help.</P>
<P>From talking a lot yesterday to not able to talk today, it was a huge difference.  Despite this, God still gives us peace and hope that God is going to help Lydia, because of her pure and faithful prayer.</P>

<P>The doctor predicted Lydia’s blood pressure will get higher and her heart rate will get lower by now.  Actually, just the opposite, Lydia’s blood pressure has been normal for the entire day today, and her pulse continued staying strong.</P>
<P>Also, her body strength seemed to be better today than yesterday.</P>
<P>God wanted us to pray and do not doubt, so that even the mountain can be moved (Matthew 21:21-22).  We pray that Lydia will be healed, and continue to glorify God using her life as a living witness.</P>
