<B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>My dear brothers and sisters,<BR>
<BR>
It's the weekend. We have been watching Lydia very closely. The nurse has<BR>
warned us that she could not get sick or have fever. Otherwise, the<BR>
operation has to be postponed.<BR>
<BR>
As I mentioned in last email, Lydia wanted to attend the piano concerto<BR>
today so much. We were a bit worried. But she wanted to go (remember she<BR>
is very determined.) Doctors were OK with it if she wants to go. So, we<BR>
did this morning.<BR>
<BR>
Lydia felt a little nausea during the ride to College Conservative of Music<BR>
hall. She probably was a little nervous also. She is still weak. Just out<BR>
of our community, she said she did not feel good. My first reaction was to<BR>
turn back home. But, "No," she said, she wanted to go.<BR>
<BR>
She made it. She finished her music piece. We came home and were very<BR>
happy. She did not win the top places like she usually did (of course, how could she?), but to<BR>
us, she is for sure our champion. To be able to do this only two weeks<BR>
after her 12 hours of brain surgery, it is amazing. We thank God greatly<BR>
for the miracle.<BR>
<BR>
Before her operation, doctor told us the possible damages of the brain<BR>
operation in that area. Two of them were: not able to speak well (need speech<BR>
therapy), and not able to use right hand and right leg freely (need physical<BR>
therapy). Jean was so strong, she said, "That is not a problem, we can<BR>
learn how to use left hand to write." But I was in deep sorrow when I heard<BR>
that, and in great fear. A few days after operation, we still did not know<BR>
how much mobility she has recovered. I asked the doctor, "Lydia has been<BR>
playing piano and cello for years. Did she lose all those skills? Does she<BR>
have to re-learn everything from scratch? Start from the simplest music<BR>
piece?" Doctor replied that he does not know, everyone is different. It<BR>
will depend on Lydia herself.<BR>
<BR>
But look at Lydia today, she is so well now. This is God's grace. We are<BR>
so limited. How much can we do? Very little. It's all from God, anything,<BR>
everything. Can we boast? Can we be proud of ourselves? No, nothing. It's<BR>
all God's blessing. Nothing we can take for granted.<BR>
<BR>
We will arrive Children hospital 6 AM Monday morning (Need to get up 5 AM).<BR>
Lydia asked Mommy when are we going to pack (last time we did not prepared,<BR>
she did not have her secure blanket, nor her favorite stuff animal with her,<BR>
and we were sent to ICU directly from radiology). Wow, she is pretty ready<BR>
and are facing it with peace and courage from God. If I were her, I<BR>
probably tried not to think about it. But it is in her mind constantly.<BR>
And yet she is joyful enough every moment. Another miracle..., because your<BR>
prayers....<BR>
<BR>
In Him<BR>
