</FONT><P>Dear Prayer Warriors, </P>
<P>&#9;"WHOO! Ahhh! OOOHHH!" Screams resounded loudly as the roller coaster rushed down the hill at top speeds. And in the front row of the roller coaster sat one very special little girl: Lydia…</P>
<P>&#9;Our entire family spent today at the Paramount King’s Island amusement park. The Adventure for Wish Kids Association, an association to help kids with life-threatening diseases, had paid for our admission tickets, and even lunch. We didn’t know what Lydia’s capacity was, or how well she could take the rides, and which rides she’d be able to ride. Of course, we just wanted to take it easy, head to the kid area, and see how she did. However, the very first ride that Lydia requested happened to be the most violent, scariest, and most intense ride in the entire kids’ area. Not only this, but she wanted to be in the front seat. With many anxieties, my parents agreed. </P>
<P>&#9;Indeed, Lydia did well the entire day, riding on many rides, especially the popular, terrifying kid rides. I held her hand tightly as <A HREF="100_9661.JPG">she rode yet another roller coaster</A>. She even went to the water park for some time. I held her as we walked deeper into the wave pool. I could tell she was very content, so happy to be having fun and playing in the water. Yet, after ten minutes, she started the familiar shivering that made me very nervous. She was able to put on some clothes and warm up without any problem. However, the brief surface and display of the weaknesses of her body frightened me. It made it so evident that Lydia had only gotten through this day by a miracle from God. </P>
<P>&#9;We then rushed home early to attend our swim meet. Lydia, for only the second time this season, was planning on swimming one event in the meet. It was a little nerve-wracking. She had already spent all day out, and was no doubt exhausted. We could only pray and hope for the best.</P>
<P>&#9;Finally, the time for her event arrived. I held her closely as Daddy prayed yet again for Lydia to be strong, and that through her everyone could see the healing power of God. She was so nervous, and wasn’t quite sure what to expect. She had gone swimming only yesterday, and had not been able to swim even a full lap. Lydia had weakened a great deal since her first meet, and we could only pray that she’d be able to finish the two laps required. </P>
<P>&#9;<I>BEEP</I>. And they began swimming. A row of little girls in swim caps, and one little girl who was completely bald. I admired her bravery. She wasn’t afraid of what people would say. She just wanted to swim her best. </P>
<P>&#9;As she swam, tears started dripping down my face, fast and furious. It was so hard for her. Yet, when I looked around the pool, I saw the pool surrounded by spectators. Team members, there to cheer Lydia on. The entire pool area echoed with cries of "Come on, Lydia! You can do it! Let’s go!" It felt as though everyone was watching. Everyone was standing behind Lydia, silently trying to push her on, urging her. I could see I wasn’t only the one whose face was covered in tears. I cried still more. Out of appreciation for these wonderful friends that God had placed in our lives. And out of appreciation for the miracle that God had performed for Lydia. </P>
<P>&#9;Lydia was spent. But she finished those last few strokes, and exhausted, pulled herself to the wall. The place erupted in cheers. Cheers for this little girl who had struggled through trials that no one, let alone a nine-year-old girl, should have to face. Encouragement for this girl who despite all her hardships, fought with determination, courage, and love. Support for a tired, weak, and weary child. And comfort that no matter what happens, she will never have to face her troubles alone, for she’ll have a loving family and friends that will always, always stand behind her. And even more, a loving Heavenly Daddy. Whose hand will always be there for her to squeeze. Whose arms will always be there to embrace her. And whose loving eyes are always watching her, telling her, "Have fun, my daughter, explore, I love you, I shall never forsake you, and don’t worry, I will always be watching you, forever and ever..."</P>
<P>Love, </P>
