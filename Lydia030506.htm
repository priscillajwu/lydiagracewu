<p><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>March
5, 06<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>My dear Prayer heroes,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Thank you for your prayers,
over the weekend, Lydia was doing quite well. Being around with the sisters
made her very happy. She also got to enjoy various delicious food and dishes
from the love of the brothers and sisters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>For the past two nights, after
came home from hospital on Friday, Jean and I had good nights of sleep. At
first, we kind of expected that Lydia would wake up during the night, and we
would need to help her and calm her down before medicine taking effect, just
like in the hospital. On the contrary, Lydia did wake up, two or three times,
during the night because of the pain. But she would take pain medicine herself,
and then tried to go back to sleep without waking up Jean or me. We were so
moved when we heard that. She is so considerate, strong, sweet, and pleasant.
We are so thankful. Praise the Lord.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia was given an <a
href="Lydia022706_benita.htm">award</a>, from OMTA (Ohio Music Teachers
Association) for her courageous determination, passion and commitment that,
only two weeks after her first brain surgery, and knowing she needed second
brain surgery two days later, she still attended the piano competition. Lydia
was very happy when she saw the awards tonight, received by mom during the
winner concert.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>A friend came to visit Lydia
today, and praised Lydia for being so brave during all of these.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;I have Lord Jesus to
help me,&quot; Lydia replied, &quot;I don’t know how can a person who does not
believe in God go through this.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>I felt exactly the same
way. When I was in ultimate sorrow, heart ache, and desperation, it’s God who
put peace into my heart in a miraculous way. He also let us know that many, so
many, people are praying for Lydia, caring about her, and loving her sincerely.
Lydia got a lot of comforts from non-stopping cards, emails, little gifts, and
visits... These also lifted up her spirits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>God cares Lydia in great
ways, and through people around us, near by or far away. This is His healing
power. We have experienced it, and we believe more will come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Do you know why is
there still residual tumor?&quot; Jean shared with me tonight, &quot;So we will
see God’s healing power and God’s glory.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;And we will be humble
before God.&quot; I added.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>This was a wonderful
weekend. Really, thank God and praise the Lord.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>In Him,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Simon<o:p></o:p></span></p>
