</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Another very rough day for Lydia.</P>
<P>Lydia’s condition seemed better controlled yesterday, and we inserted the NG tube and started to feed her through the pump slowly.  However, today, she was constantly feeling very nauseous, several severe vomiting, although with max dose and frequency of five different nauseous medicines used.</P>
<P>During the evening, we had to stop the feeding machine since she kept feeling very sick in her stomach.</P>
<P>However, she continued feeling terrible.  We decided to switch to a smaller size tube, so the irritation to her mouth, throat, and stomach might be reduced.</P>
<P>Once the NG tube was pulled out, Lydia said,</P>
<P>&quot;Wow, it feels so good now without the tube.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;We will change to a smaller tube.&quot;  I said.</P>
<P>&quot;No, I would not let them put the tube back in again.&quot;  Lydia almost cried, &quot;It was so uncomfortable.  It made me so sick.&quot;</P>
<P>Then, that was very difficult for us.  I was in deep sadness about the situation.  Really, Lydia has not eaten much by mouth at all for last few days.  All her nutrition was from IV and tube feed.  And her weight continued dropping.</P>
<P>&quot;In order not to have the tube put back in, you need to be able to eat.&quot; I said.</P>
<P>&quot;OK, I’ll do it.&quot;  Lydia said willingly.</P>
<P>So we got a piece of brownie and tried to feed her, with the hope that maybe she would be able to start eating miraculously.</P>
<P>She swallowed the first little bite, and second little bite made her almost threw up again…</P>
<P>&quot;Please let them put the tube back in, Lydia.  For us, for everyone of us in the family.&quot;  I told Lydia.</P>
<P>With crying terribly and a lot of tears from Lydia and Mom, Lydia extremely reluctant allowed the nurse to put the NG tube back into her nose and all the way to her stomach.</P>
<P>This time, the tube irritated her a lot.  Almost at once, she start vomiting severely, and with some blood in it…</P>
<P>The entire process was heart breaking and difficult to watch.  I had to continuously pray for God’s help.</P>
<P>She continuously struggled for hours afterward, until we put two strong drowsy medicines and morphine to her.  She was able to fall asleep with tears and weakness shown on her face.</P>

<P>We thank God for helping us to get through the day with just enough strength.  Really, it was so difficult and writing this letter is a struggle.  Praise the Lord, it’s finally over.  Tomorrow will come by itself, I really can not worry about it.  I still have to get up many times during the night for Lydia’s bathroom trips…</P>
