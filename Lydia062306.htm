<P>Dear Friends,</P>

<P>&#9;&quot;I want to go to VBS, but Mommy won’t let me!&quot; I squeezed Lydia’s hand as she expressed her frustration. Lydia had gone to Vacation Bible School at church just about every year since she had been old enough to attend. It had always been a lot of fun: talking with friends, playing games, doing funny motions during worship time, and learning more about God. This year, however, was different. </P>
<P>&#9;Instead of the eager anticipation that usually preceded the week of VBS, Lydia was anxiously sitting in the hospital, undergoing chemotherapy. As the week went on, it became obvious that Lydia was going to need a feeding tube, delaying her from leaving the hospital. Meanwhile, her blood count was dropping because of the damaging and intense treatment, and was predicted to be at an all time low. There seemed to be no way that Lydia would be able to attend the first few days of VBS.</P>
<P>&#9;The week of VBS began for my other two sisters and I. Each day after worship, the VBS coordinator would ask the kids different quiz questions about what they had learned the previous day. And every day, she reminded the kids of Lydia. All one hundred some kids prayed for Lydia, praying that she would feel better, keep fighting, and hopefully come to VBS someday that week. I was amazed and truly appreciated all the kindness that these young children showed. Each day I hoped that Lydia would make it, and each day I was disappointed. </P>
<P>&#9;On Thursday night, I was massaging Lydia’s leg as she tried to get to sleep. Of course, the subject started to turn toward VBS. Only then did I realize just <B>how much</B> Lydia wanted to attend VBS. Tears started forming in her eyes as her voice started rising in pitch and volume while she told me that Mommy was afraid to take any risks. Alarmed, my mom ran into the room, wondering what was wrong. I indignantly asked my mom why Lydia couldn’t at least go visit the kids at VBS. My mom, just as indignantly, retorted that she wasn’t going to take the risk of Lydia possibly getting sick because of her low blood count, and thus very little protection from getting ill. However, we came up with a plan to let Lydia talk to the kids who had been praying for her all week. </P>
<P>&#9;Today I brought in Lydia’s old feeding tube to share to the kids. I told the kids how much Lydia wanted to be there, and that she sent her love. Then, I suggested that the kids might be able to talk to Lydia. I pulled out a phone and dialed home. My mom answered and I told her I was on stage and to put Lydia on the phone. By putting the phone by a microphone and holding the phone toward the kids, Lydia and the VBS kids were able to have a little conversation. </P>
<P>&#9;Hearing Lydia’s voice made all the kids smile, and later on many adults and teenagers expressed how inspiring it was to hear Lydia. The kids shouted back to her with enthusiasm and a true, encouraging love that gave me a warm feeling inside. And from the sound of Lydia’s voice, it was clear that she appreciated the kids even more than I did. Lydia sounded more cheerful and happy than I had heard her sound in such a long time. Her voice was bright and I could picture the cute, little girl, beaming as she heard her close friends tell her to get well. </P>
<P>After a couple of minutes, it was time to say good-bye. And what a good-bye! The VBS kids’ parting remark was one that I’m sure Lydia will remember for some time to come…</P>

<P>&quot;We Love You, Lydia!&quot;</P>
<P>Indeed the love of these kids seemed heaven-given. Each one a little angel sent to tell Lydia just how much her Father in heaven loved her, and would be with her no matter how hard the day seems.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Love, </P>
