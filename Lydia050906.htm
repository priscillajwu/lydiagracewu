<p><span style='font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Arial'>May 9, 2006, Tuesday<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>We prayed hard yesterday
about Lydia’s eating problem ….<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Usually Lydia would try to
avoid the meals. She would mention she was not feeling good, nauseous, or
tired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Tonight, the same way, we
had hard time to get her on the dinner table.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>However, we have food
prepared by a family from the church. The dishes looked very delicious. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Normally I would do the
prayer. But today, I made Lydia pray and give thanks to the Lord. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>We all enjoyed the food a
lot, except Lydia. She still only watched around without even giving a try. Mom
tried to feed her slowly, like feeding a baby (that reminded me mother’s day is
coming). Gradually, she started eating by herself, and more and more. She liked
it. At the end, she ate a lot. We were so joyful. According to mom, this is the
largest amount in one meal for Lydia recently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>It’s really a miracle. It’s
also a great comfort from our Lord for He answered our prayers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>We also noticed today’s food
is spicier. Lydia’s taste buds probably got damaged by the radiation to some
extent. Spicy food may help. Thank God for showing us some hints to improve her
appetite.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>We pray that Lydia’s will
start to eat better, gain weight, and be ready for the first chemo therapy which
was scheduled to be May 30.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Like to share happy moments
with you. Praise the Lord.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
