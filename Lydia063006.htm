<P>It was such a drama on the past few days. We just couldn’t decide what to do on this Independent Day long weekend. Normally, our whole family will go to the Midwest Christians Summer Retreat for this long weekend. But this year the situation is different. We couldn’t plan anything ahead of time, because Lydia’s condition could vary from time to time. We have learned to take one day at a time. Everyone wanted to go to the Retreat, even Lydia herself. It won’t be a good idea for her to go because her blood count is low. If everyone went except for Lydia, Lydia will be very lonely and miserable for the whole weekend. What should we do? We even thought that we might take the whole family to an outdoor vacation without contacting with a lot of people. We prayed, and prayed. We asked God for wisdom. Until this morning…, it seemed everything fell into the right place.</P>

<P>We couldn’t find a good place to go with both the lodging and distance concerns. Priscilla (our youngest one) agreed to stay home to accompany Lydia. So we decided to let only our two older ones go to the Retreat.</P>

<P>We don’t like to be apart during this time. But Lydia reminded us what I told her before. </P>

<B><I><P>&quot;This year is just different from the regular years. We only take a year out of routine to do something different.&quot;</P>

</I><P>Yes! A very &quot;different&quot; year! A year that would help us to learn more unforgettable experiences and grows closer to God.</P>
<P>Thank you, Jesus!</P>
