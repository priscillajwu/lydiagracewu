</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Finally, we got the May 22 MRI report today. Praise the Lord, the results were very encouraging. The tumors have decreased, and were not apparent, according to the radiologist. (So no measurement could be taken, nothing to measure.) All the doctors and nurses were really happy with the results. The radiation treatment has gone really well.</P>
<P>Now we all have witnessed that our God is truly faithful. He answers our prayers. Last Monday was pretty scary moment. But we should not get distracted. We should still have faith in Him. Our Lord have delivered us, and He will continue deliver us, just like now.</P>
<P>Lydia lost one kg (2.2 pounds) within last one week, almost 5% of her body weight in one week. She continues losing weight. The doctors were concerned. Lydia is now under medications for her appetite.</P>
<P>Also, Lydia’s first chemo therapy has been postponed by two weeks. She just need to get recovered more before she can get any chemo treatment. She was not happy at all. She just wanted it to start as soon as possible and get over with it. But, we have to believe the doctors have good reasons to delay it. </P>
<P>I, well, continue being weak and having very severe lower abdominal pain. I went to see the doctor, and was referred to emergency room right away for further check up. They checked urine, blood, and I was in patient gown, I can’t believe it. I kept thinking about Lydia when I was in ER. Recall what she has been through lately…</P>
<P>My CT scan showed pretty bad colitis (colon inflammation). Thank God, it was not appendicitis. But ER doctor thought what I have may be worse. However, the medications I was given made me very very nauseous. Like father, like daughter (not only the hair style), I am feeling nauseous now, like Lydia. Sound like a joke, isn’t it. But it’s true, just share with you. I don’t know how to explain this. Maybe I need to be more sympathetic about Lydia’s difficulty in eating.</P></FONT></BODY>
