<FONT SIZE=4><P>Our Dear Prayer Partner,</P>
<P>Today is Easter Sunday!</P>
</FONT><P><A HREF="100_8055.JPG"><FONT SIZE=4>Lydia</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4> was very excited and happy this morning. Because we plan to bring her to church, if she was feeling well. So she did go for the very first time after she got sick.</P>
<P>We really appreciated that most of people treat her as normal as before by not getting too excited to see her and wanted to get too close to her. I am sorry that we have to keep her away from being sick, so… Thank you!</P>
<P>She cried for I was not allowed her to play in a very excited way. She likes to have company, but it’s hard!</P>
<P>When I am thinking about Jesus’ resurrection. I can say He lives! He is the living God. When the night before Lydia’s surgery, Lydia was suffering severe headache, and was not able to sleep well. When I saw she was in extremely pain, I cried and my heart was aching. </P>
<P>I asked her "Have you wondered why it’s you? Why you’re suffering?"</P>
<P>"No. God has chosen me" Lydia answered with firm voice.</P>
<P>"Why?" Mom was curious.</P>
<P>She replied, " He wants me to have this special experience, later on, I can help other people."</P>
<P>What a strong faith she has!</P>
<P>She couldn’t take strong pain medicine to kill her pain before surgery. Doctors didn’t want the side effects of pain medicine to confuse her condition. Lydia asked me to sing to her to comfort her. The first song popped into my head was the song I was prepared to lead in the Sunday worship on that coming Sunday.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="CENTER">How Precious You are To Me (Isaiah 53: 4-5)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Jesus, You took the cross, carried my sorrows, paid for my life with Yours.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Jesus, pierced for my sin and all my shame, and crushed for my failures and pain.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">You have suffered for me to give me peace,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">by the stripes upon You, </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000">I received healing, You made me whole.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="CENTER">Thank You Jesus, my loving Savior.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">You shed Your blood to give me life.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">O my Jesus, You loves me so.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">O how precious You are to me.</P>
</B></I><P>When I sang to the part of " You made me whole", the Chinese meaning is "being completely healed"; I cried and cried. I knew God had confirmed me one more time with this song that God would heal Lydia completely.</P>
<P>On this Easter Sunday, I thank God He gave us His Son, Jesus. Even Lydia and we still have a long journey ahead of us, we are going to hold on tightly His promise, especially, the verses Isaiah 53: 4-5.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Love,</P>
<P>Jean</P></FONT></BODY>
