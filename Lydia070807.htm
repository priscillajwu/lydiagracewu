<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>The toughest situation I’ve been
through was dealing with the illness and death of my little sister last year.
My sister Lydia was 9 when she was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor, cancer.
She ended up spending many of her next months in and out of the hospital doing
treatments of radiation and chemotherapy. Lydia was the sister with whom I
always identified with most out of my 3 little sisters. Always lively,
energetic, vibrant, incredibly intelligent, and willing to try new things. When
a suggestion was brought up, Lydia was the first to speak up and
enthusiastically support it, or reject it with firm logic. It was impossible to
watch as she lost all her hair, her never-ending energy, her walking ability,
her speaking ability, and eventually her life. It was unthinkable that the
splitting headaches that signified the beginning had led to this in a short 7
months. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>Yet despite all that Lydia did lose,
what is important is what she kept and gave. She showed love that never failed
to truly everyone. Her unceasing faith and hope that her Jesus would heal her
inspired all around her. She really did have more faith than any of us. Yes, I
always knew that the faith of a child is what we all should have, but this gave
me a whole new perspective. I had always felt that if put to the test, my faith
would stand. To see my sister of 9 years face this life-threatening disease
with such simple acceptance and trust in her Father, put me to shame. I always
asked myself, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>If I were the one with
cancer, what would I be like?</i> I hoped that my attitude and faith could be
half my sister’s. I have no idea of the pain, frustration, and sadness that she
must have felt, but I do know that I probably would not have been able to
handle it all. God humbled me through my little sister. Reminding me once again
that I have so much room for growth in Him. And also showing me that I have
been so blessed, and I need to appreciate all of it always, for He can give and
take away. And He will. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>These last several months, nearing a
year now after her death, have been just as difficult. The pain ebbs and
attacks, and ebbs again, but never goes away. Now I face grieving parents whose
lives have been shaken and many ideas and opinions dramatically altered.
Depression is a word that is now sometimes used in the household. I can not yet
see the light at the end of the tunnel, but I know there must be one. God is
holding the hands of everyone in the family as we blindly and weakly struggle
toward that light. He will bring us out stronger than ever when we are ready.
If anything, God is teaching me to hold on, to keep trusting Him, and letting
Him guide the way especially in the wake of disaster. And I know He will not
let me fall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>If I am selected as Brio Girl, I hope to be able to
encourage my Brio sisters. Just recently I have gone through one of the most
difficult situations someone can go through: the death of a sibling. Through
it, I continue to learn and grow in the Lord. I want to be able to share my
story and help those who have gone through similar circumstances. To offer
comfort, encouragement, love, and hope knowing they are not alone in their
struggles. There are others like them and God is never far away. I wish to
inspire all my sisses to continue to love their Father and to grow in Him.
Faith is so very important in all cases: going off to college, tragedies, and
regular day-to-day life. My little sister’s faith in the face of death has
inspired me, and I wish to share her story to as many as I can, helping others
in their own walks to overcome fears, insecurities, and sin in order to mature
in Him. And I want all my sisters to know how incredibly much their Heavenly
Daddy loves them. I hope to a beacon that illuminates His undying love for each
and every one of them. And I wish for them to know that I, as their sister,
love them, and can’t wait to see them, if not on this earth, then in our
Father’s home, where we will spend eternity together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
