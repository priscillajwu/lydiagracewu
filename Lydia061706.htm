</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Saturday morning, I had very good spiritual time with Lydia. I read entire book of Philippians to her. We were inspired with many encouraging and comforting verses. We both like Philippians 4:13 very much.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, Lydia went to activity room with Mom. Over there, Lydia threw up terribly and caused a lot of blood bleeding from her nose. It was quite scary and messy.</P>
<P>During the evening, nurse came over asking what kind of medicine Lydia would like to have for her nausea, while Lydia was very sick and closed her eyes tightly.</P>
<P>"What kind of medicine do you want, Lydia." I asked her.</P>
<P>"She may not need it. She wants to fight it." Mom answered for Lydia on her bedside.</P>
<P>I was surprised, since I was away (went home) in the afternoon, and did not realized that Lydia has decided to cut down her needs of medication so that she could go home as soon as possible. According to the doctor, she has to be well enough before we can discharge from the hospital. Certainly, Lydia was not happy that she was not home yet by now.</P>
<P>"Are you sure you don’t want any?" I asked Lydia again.</P>
<P>Lydia nodded her head, still with eyes tightly closed, and discomfort shown on her face.</P>
<P>"Well, let me know if you change your mind." Nurse said with amazement and left.</P>
<P>I also looked at Mom and Lydia with disbelief.</P>
<P>Again, Lydia continued amazing me with her determination and strength in her.  Praise the Lord. </P>
<P>We had great family prayers together in the hospital before Lydia’s sisters left for home. Each prayer brought peace and comfort to us from our Lord, Christ Jesus.</P>
