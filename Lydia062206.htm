</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Lydia has been trying her best to eat as much she could since yesterday.  Truly, she had eaten more yesterday and today since her chemotherapy.  It was a great job for her to be able to eat more.  I was really moved by her determination and willingness although she was feeling nauseous all the time.  However, she has not eaten quite enough.  She knew it too.  So we were back to the hospital early this morning and to get the feeding tube inserted…</P>

<P>Many new things happened for Lydia today.  It was a long and stressful, and tiring day for Lydia and Mom.</P>

<P>First of all, her blood count, as the doctors expected, have gone down to almost ZERO.  Being lack of red, white blood cells, and platelet.  She is in great danger of infection and bleeding.  She got blood transfusion in the morning.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, she got very strong reaction after the platelet transfusion.  Both her eyes and lips were swollen.  The nurse got scared and called for doctors quickly.  A high dose steroid was injected right away and various medicines were used.  Then, she has to be monitored closely in the hospital…</P>
<P>Sevral hours later, her condition got better.  Also, since she was under so many different kinds of medication, she was like somewhat sedated and acted weirdly, and was very emotional.  She was also very scared of new NJ tube insertion procedure.  (Different from NG tube which only reaches stomach, and got thrown up easily when she vomited.  NJ tube extended all the way into the intestine.)  It was a more complex procedure, and required X-ray to help.</P>
<P>Lydia was half awake, and was crying because of her fear of new NJ tube procedure.  (She dislikes any kind of feeding tube anyway because of previous bad experiences.)</P>
<P>Overcoming her fear through constant prayers, and Dad and Mom accompany her all the time.  The NJ tube was inserted.  It was very difficult before, during, and after the procedure.  However, she did a good job, and awarded by the doctor and nurses the &quot;patient of the day&quot;.</P>
<P>To comfort her, I shared Ephesians 3:20 to her.  It helped.</P>
<P>By the time Lydia got home was in the evening.</P>

<P>We watched PBS special program tonight about the journey of several families fighting with childhood cancer.  It’s very difficult to watch.  Our tears kept coming out.  We could relate to a lot of them, the suffering, the sorrow, the pain, the fear, the frustration, the distress, the despair, the worry, the anger, the doubt, the bitterness…  However, I also saw the hope from the faith, the comfort from the love and support, and the strength from the prayers.</P>

<P>Truly, I can see there is a strong connection between the suffering and the true meaning of life, and the beauty of it through the perseverance of seeking our Lord.</P>
<P>And without God, suffering has no meaning.</P>
<P>With our Lord Jesus Christ, the suffering has made us know God more, and love God more.</P>
<P>All we have to do is to live what is given to us in a godly way (no matter how unfair it seems).</P>
<P>May the name of the Lord be praised.</P>
