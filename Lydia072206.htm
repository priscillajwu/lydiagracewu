</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Early yesterday morning, Lydia’s doctor came over to tell us the good news of MRI results, no evidence of tumor recurrence.  Everybody, mom and dad, doctors, nurses, especially Lydia had a great relief.  At that moment, we thank the Lord deep in our hearts.  Yes, God is faithful, and has much grace and mercy.</P>
<P>We were told that we could go home.</P>
<P>However, only several hours later, after Lydia received another blood transfusion, and Mom is about to take Lydia home.  Lydia would not move.  Her headache and stomach pain came back and bothered her so much.</P>
<P>&quot;We have not found the cause of the headache and the stomach pain yet.&quot;  Lydia said.</P>
<P>The doctors had suggested that we could see other specialty doctors for further treatment.  However, we still need to go home, there is nothing we need to do at hospital.</P>
<P>It’s strange that Lydia always wanted to go home everytime she got admitted to the hospital.  Recently, it has been a bit different.</P>
<P>Anyway, Lydia got home in the evening.</P>
<P>We have been taking the pain and nauseous medicines as much as we are allowed, hoping that Lydia would feel better.  </P>
<P>Also, we have been very easy these two days.  Lydia would not do anything, other than watch TVs or sleep.  This is not Lydia.  She has always been a hard worker.</P>
<P>Lydia also started to lose her eyebrow hair.  And this made her look even more sick and pale.</P>
<P>Anyway, many lessons we need to learn.  We understand that God allowed all of these to happen.  We have to go on and hold on to our heavenly father, for He knows the best about what we are facing and He knows our future.  And that is comforting.</P>
