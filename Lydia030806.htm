<p><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>March
8, 06<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>A
conversation between Esther and Lydia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;The
most fear people have for brain surgery is that they may die in the operation,
never wake up again.&quot; Esther said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;No,
that is not scary, if I do not wake up, then I will be with the Lord
Jesus.&quot; Lydia said, &quot;what I feared the most is that I woke up in the
middle of surgery, and found out my head is open. That will be pretty
scary.&quot; Isn’t that something! About the Children’s faith. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Since
grandma is leaving tomorrow. Everybody would like to say something to thank
grandma, while daddy was video taping it. Three sisters said something about
thanking her for fixing them the meals and daily schedule. Lydia said,
&quot;Thank you for taking care of sisters, so that Mom and Dad can take care
of me in hospital.&quot; One after another, everyone said something to
appreciate, including mom and dad. Grandma was very happy. We were all happy
and thankful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Yes,
thank the Lord for the grandma to be able to be with us in this greatest trial
ever in our family. As matter of fact, this is the longest time grandma ever
spent with us. It was not easy for her, since she really not used many things
here (she lived in Taiwan for all her life.). During last month, she clogged
kitchen sink, broke the vacuum machine…. Because she was really trying very
hard to help us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I
always remember the moment I picked her up in the airport, the day after Lydia
was diagnosed with brain tumor. She said,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Not
to worry, everything will be OK, I have prayed. I have faith that almighty God
will watch over us….&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>It’s
a great blessing that we have a grandma with great faith. Thank the Lord.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>In
Him,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Simon<o:p></o:p></span></p>
