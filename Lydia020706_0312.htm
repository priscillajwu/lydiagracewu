<B><P>As requested by XuiZhong (Simon) Wu, would you please NOT go to visit Lydia for now. They want to spend more time with her in ICU. Life is full of suprises, just pray!<BR>
<BR>
Psalm 66:18 "If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened." Let's throw ourselves before the LORD, confess our iniquity, and cry out for help. He is full of grace and mercy and He will listen to our intercession.<BR>
<BR>
I propose that we come and pray together in DUMC at 6:00~7:00AM on Thursday (2/9). It's ok to leave earlier than 7:00 if you have to.<BR>
<BR>
Also, please sign up a slot (an hour) for 24-hr-prayer if you will, starting tonight 6:00pm. We can do many times of praying for Lydia for 1 min within an hour if we are working. Even that counts as prayers if we just think of her and pray to God in our mind.<BR>
<BR>
Jim, can you make contact with DUMC and ask permission for using the building?<BR>
<BR>
In Christ,<BR>
