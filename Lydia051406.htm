<FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Today is Mother’s day. Since yesterday, we’ve tried to do something to make mom happy. This morning, I got some special breakfast for everyone. It was good except Lydia did not eat much.</P>
<P>Sunday worship was good too. Mother’s day special service went very well. Kids made flower for their mothers. It was fun and enjoyable. I praised the Lord for that.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, while everybody got together for supper, Lydia did not want to eat again. She has not eaten much since she got up this morning. </P>
<P>I got very frustrated and very angry at the way she sat. She curled up her legs on the chair. To me, that was exactly why she could not eat. She compressed her stomach. She cried and said she was doing her best trying to eat. But she could not. She was nauseous.</P>
<P>I wanted her to find out how much she weights. She went and stayed in the bathroom. She did not come out and was crying inside. Mom went to check and ask what was going on. </P>
<P>"I am so scared to come out, I have lost weight, I am afraid daddy is going to get mad." Lydia said.</P>
<P>I told her, I am not surprised that she lost weight further, from the way she has not been eating well.</P>
<P>Of course, nobody had appetite to eat anything after I got really angry. Almost everybody was crying except me. I felt so bad and apologized. Mom reminded me that I was over-reacting. Eating became so much pressure for Lydia nowadays (probably because of me). I need to loosen up. Let’s slowly help Lydia for her eating problem (although she has been taking anti-nauseous medicines regularly).</P>
<P>Mom was right. I pray that God help me not to be so tense about it.</P>
<P>Sometimes, Lydia seems to have recovered well. But sometimes does not look like it. She has more headaches and nauseous in the morning, at least to me, in the recent few days. And that really scares me because that is exactly the symptom of brain tumor…</P>
<P>However, mom seems to be able to handle the situations better than me. I am thankful for her being a great wife and mom. She has been taking care the entire family wonderfully. </P>
<P>Thank you, Lord.</P></FONT></BODY>
