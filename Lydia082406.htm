</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>It’s first day of school. Three girls each got a thick stack of forms for us to go through and sign. Mom joked that we had one less stack to worry about. Again, a lot of tears came out when she said that.</P>
<P>We visited the funeral home to take a look of Lydia’s body again. Mom just needed to make sure everything is fine. Of course, the trip brought a lot of pain, sorrow, and tears again.</P>
<P>Many have tried to comfort us (and we know it too well) that we will meet Lydia again in the Lord. Today, it came to me that, in the normal pace (truly I hope it can be sooner), it could take mom and dad several decades before that happens. And it could be at least twice as long for Lydia’s sisters to meet her again. That is a long wait, way too long. This got me really puzzled and made me terribly sad. I had to stop crying and calm down and pray very hard. Later, God gave me peace that whenever I feel the wait is too long, I should come to the Lord, and He will comfort me directly, for I know Lydia is with the Lord any moment. Although I do not have direct contact with Lydia, but the Lord does. There is no use for me to find out what Lydia is doing right now. It has to be much better than I can imagine. Lydia’s ten years of life is so good that I can continuously remember, and share to many people.</P>
<P>I thank God that the importance of Lord Jesus surpassed mom and dad very early in Lydia’s life. She could find comfort in the Lord, not only mom and dad. As she said, a lot of times, she has to suffer and be alone by herself during surgeries, test, scan, etc… at those times, only Jesus was with her.</P>
<P>Now, Lydia is with her best friend, Lord Jesus, the almighty God, who knows how to love Lydia a lot better than mom and dad. And that is comforting.</P>
<P>Lydia has done a good job to live her life. As in the scripture,</P>
<P>"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith." 2 Timothy 4:7.</P>
<P>Therefore, we hope that Lydia’s funeral service be like a farewell celebration party. We are celebrating for her job well done, and handing her over to the Lord. You can wear red clothes if you feel to, since Lydia’s favorite color is red.</P>
<P>During the visitation and memorial service, other than dress red, please do not cry, because that would make us cry further, and we may not be able to handle it…</P></FONT></BODY>
