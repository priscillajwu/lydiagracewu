</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Lydia continued having a very tough day today.  It’s already fourth week of her chemotherapy.  She should have a good days by now.  Not quite so.</P>
<P>Lydia had another acupuncture treatment today.  Originally, we were hoping a good longer treatment.  Because we felt it seems helpful two previous times.  However, today, Lydia refused to get pierced as much as planned.  She said it was very painful.  So the treatment was cut short.  Mom was very frustrated.  At the end of treatment, Lydia still had severe discomfort.  She grabbed both hands of the acupuncture doctor.</P>
<P>&quot;Please help me.&quot;  Lydia cried.</P>
<P>I was not there.  Mom described to me.  It must be a very sad moments for the people around.</P>
<P>After Lydia and mom came home, for whatever reason, Lydia felt very hungry.  Maybe it was because of acupuncture.  Mom soon prepared some food for her.  Not long after she ate something, she threw all up, and very severe one.  It was terrible and messy.  Poor little Lydia, she did that again at night.  It lasted a long time, seemed forever.  She kept vomited, again and again.  Very difficult to watch.</P>
<P>Before bedtime, we tried something new.  Usually, it’s mom and dad working on the medicines, feeding preparation, etc.  Tonight, all three siblings helped.  They learned how to take blood pressure and pulse, feed Lydia medicines (through tube injection and there are a lot of medicines Lydia needs to take, so everybody got many chances), dropped medicine into her ears, and work on the feeding pump.  Of course, everybody continued massaging her.  Lydia felt very happy, and said, &quot;We have sweet family.  I love you all.&quot;</P>
<P>Thank God, indeed, for the moments like these.</P>
<P>Also, thank God that Lydia’s blood test today, showed the blood counts have come up.  Although with all the sufferings, at least the blood results could be as expected.</P>
<P>Lydia’s hearing and kidney function started to show problems as the results of the chemotherapy.  We are very concerned.  Please pray for that.  We cast Lydia in God’s hand, everything about Lydia in God’s hand….</P>
