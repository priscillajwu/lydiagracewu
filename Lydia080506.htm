</FONT><P>Dear Prayer Warriors,</P>
<P>&#9;"This little light of mine…I’m gonna let it shine. This little light of mine…I’m gonna let it shine. Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine." This is a song I always hear the little kids sing, with their cute little voice and hand motions. Yet today, when members of our church youth group came to visit Lydia, this was the first song they sang. I never realized that this song could have such a meaning. And I never thought about the difficulty of truly letting your light shine. </P>
<P>&#9;Lydia hasn’t been doing too great these last few days. Headaches are frequent visitors for her, and long sessions of vomiting can also be heard throughout the house. Since she got back from the hospital last night, Lydia hasn’t gone outside or really done much. And the worst part of it is that tomorrow is her birthday. She’ll have to spend her birthday at home, and under the worst conditions possible: feeling absolutely terrible. Still, today we were reminded that despite all the impenetrable darkness that we feel, a strong ray of light could come shining through. </P>
<P>&#9;Today she had a few friends come to visit her, bringing her gifts and birthday balloons. One of her best friends spent a couple hours with us playing and game and watching some TV. Despite her sudden gasps of pain, I know that just being able to have a friend visit for once must have really made Lydia happy. My parents also spent some time with her flipping through cards she’s received as well as many birthday greetings that have come in these last few days. </P>
<P>&#9;Toward the end of the day, youth from our church youth group came and <A HREF="100_0185.JPG">sang worship songs</A> and happy birthday. There were so many of them. Their cars made a little line running down the street. As I took pictures of the visitors, I smiled widely. This was such a gift for Lydia. I hadn’t seen her smile in days, yet a smile graced her face as she watched the youth intently and sometimes sang along. My mom was quickly in full-fledged tears. Tears came running down my own face as we sang… "I could sing of Your love forever…I could sing of Your love forever." It must be so hard, yet Lydia can still sing praises to God of His wondrous love despite her many hardships. I kept crying as I thought of just how much Lydia and our family has gone through. A couple of my friends wrapped their arms around me as we continued to sing. </P>
<P>&#9;I hadn’t seen my little sister so alive in many days. The visitors’ energy and love seemed to course through her. She sat and listened to many songs, greatly appreciating the fact that so many had remembered her birthday. And that they had made a special voyage to come to wish her and to try to brighten her day. And it did. It truly, truly did. Lydia needs it so much. This week has been so tough for her, and her third chemotherapy starts next week. Her spirits have been so low. But her visitors really cheered her up. I’m so glad Lydia was able to see just how many people are thinking of her, praying for her, and loving her. </P>
<P>&#9;As I asked her about the songs later on. She said that the song that she actually remembered the most was This Little Light of Mine. I was surprised. However, she continued to explain her choice by saying that she was going to keep her little light shining. Wow. Her light had seemed to be flickering these last few days, but it seemed that new fuel had been poured upon it, and it was once again burning a little steadier. And it will keep burning. Despite Satan’s blowing. And all the winds and tornadoes that will rock it. And the storms that will rain down on top of it. No. Her little light will keep shining. And she won’t hide it under a bush either. No indeed. And a great thanks to her fuel-adding visitors, for Lydia’s light is now once again gleaming brightly. Lydia Grace Wu has said she will keep her little light shining. Praise God. </P>
<P>Love to all, </P>
