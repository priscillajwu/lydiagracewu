</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>In the morning, Lydia had some neurological symptoms.  Nurses quickly notified the doctor.  After examining Lydia, the doctor told us the end for Lydia is anytime now.</P>
<P>Awfully saddened and with huge doubt to whatever doctor said, we got Esther, Deborah, (Priscilla is already here), and grandparents rushed to the hospital.</P>
<P>&quot;I love you mommy&quot;, &quot;I love you daddy&quot;, &quot;I love you Esther&quot;, &quot;I love you Deborah&quot;, &quot;I love you Priscilla&quot;, Lydia kept saying &quot;I love you&quot; to everyone in the family, again and again, and non-stopping for hours.</P>
<P>&quot;I love you too, Lydia.&quot;  Everyone was crying badly.  Worst ever.</P>
<P>Pastors, friends, started to show up to see Lydia.  Lydia kept saying &quot;I love you&quot; to everyone who came to see her.</P>
<P>My mind and heart were broken into pieces.  I was torn apart.  Surviving is the most difficult thing for me at those moments.</P>
<P>We all kept praying and crying out to God for His healing.  We could not believe this is it.  There are so many people praying for Lydia…</P>
<P>A few hours later, Lydia became more stable and fell asleep, people started to leave.  However, the doctor warned the death could be hours or couple days from now.</P>
<P>Scared by the doctor, although still believe God is going to heal Lydia, all of us in the family stayed in the hospital with Lydia tonight.</P>
<P>Lydia had tremendous sufferings and discomforts throughout the rest of the day.  All of us tended to her at the same time.</P>
<P>It was too much suffering for a little ten year old girl to bear.  We were in the extreme sorrow.  Our hearts broken into pieces while we watching Lydia.</P>
<P>Also, the entire day, again and again (hundreds of time), Lydia prayed</P>
<P>&quot;Lord Jesus, please help me to get well.&quot;</P>
<P>It’s extremely difficult for us to hear her saying that.  She still continues having great faith and hope.</P>
<P>At night, in the family bedtime prayers, we cried out to God for His healing.  It’s too cruel for us to lose Lydia.  Loving heavenly father, please have mercy on us…</P>
