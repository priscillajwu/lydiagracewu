Uncle Simon and family:<br>
<br>
Hope you are doing well. I apologize for my ineloquence and the naivety of my
thoughts, but I felt compelled to write this - I hope it helps in some way.<br>
<br>
I thought of Lydia today, and decided to check Uncle Simon's blog for updates.
It pains me to see that your grieving continues, and it breaks my heart when I
read the sorrow in your writing. Yet at the same time, the immense and
impassioned love with which you loved your daughter touches me and continues to
touch me daily. I was blessed to have known Lydia, to have talked to her,
taught her, joked with her, watched her smile, heard her laugh, heard her sing.
Every time I think of her and her amazing faith, I am simultaneously humbled
and inspired, and reminded of God's blessing and power. There is no question
that she profoundly affected my life.<br>
<br>
Since leaving Cincinnati, I've met some amazing people, many with extraordinary
accomplishment and promise - people you meet, and think &quot;they'll become somebody
someday.&quot; But when I am with these new people and conversation turns to
the amazing people we have known in our lives, the first person that I speak of
is Lydia. And there is little doubt in my mind that many years from now, when
my bones are old and brittle, that, more than the presidential-wannabes, more
than the corporate legends, after ambitions, careers, and the material of this
world fade to grey, I will continue speak of Lydia. And that years from now,
when I think of Lydia, she will remain as always: a woman of God who loved and
knew how to love, who inspired, who had immaculate faith as only a child can
have, who epitomized strength.<br>
<br>
I cannot claim to empathize, to know the unimaginable pain of losing someone so
dear to your heart. I am too naive, too young in the world to do so. But I do
know that, like thousands of others, Lydia touched my life because of her love,
and the love of Christ that was shown through her. And similarly, that your
incredible love for your daughter, the love that drove you to raise her, to
pray for her, to sit by her side, to hold her hand, and that now causes you to
grieve and suffer - that this love and its manifestation is in no way
punishment from God or an indication of failure, but instead something genuinely
amazing to be celebrated, something to be cherished, and something that
inspired and continues to inspire those around you. As a son, witnessing such
abounding love touches me in the deepest of senses, and I hope that one day I
might be able to love my child as you loved yours. We were all blessed to have
known Lydia, and even more, permit my youth to say this, you were blessed to
have raised, to have known, and to have loved so dearly and intensely Lydia for
her ten beautiful years on this earth. I pray that in your darkest days along
this journey, that you might remember this, and that the Lord may be with you
and give you strength.<br>
<br>
As always, you will be in my prayers.<br>
<br>
Love,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
