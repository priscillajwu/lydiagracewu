<div class=Section1>

<p><span style='font-size:7.5pt'>May 4, 2006, Thursday<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia
did not go to school today, since she had doctor appointments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Thank
you for your prayers, Lydia’s blood count has gone up some. We (and doctors)
were very happy. Although the numbers were still much lower than normal range,
Lydia should not have problem to perform the school musical this weekend.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Mom
has been helping Lydia to take bath or shower these days. But tonight, mom was
really too busy to help. She told Lydia to take shower by herself. (Lydia
should be able to do that, just did not have enough confidence yet.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia
cried and very hesitated, but still she took her clothes and walked into the
bathroom with tears on her face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Deborah
saw it and followed Lydia into bathroom and asked, &quot;Do you need
help?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Yeah,
can you wait here while I take shower, just in case I do not have the strength
to stand.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>So,
Deborah stood there in the bathroom, waiting for Lydia to take shower. Just in
case Lydia may need help. Wasn’t it sweet?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Priscilla
has a little bit of cough today. Tonight, Lydia and Deborah were watching the
school year book together. Priscilla came over sitting next to Lydia and
coughed. Lydia immediately jumped up and got away from Priscilla. Priscilla got
so upset, she did not know why Lydia was doing that. Lydia said, &quot;I am
afraid to get sick.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Why
don’t you say so.&quot; Priscilla said, &quot;I felt so bad when you did
that.&quot; Well, life is difficult for us sometimes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Usually,
Priscilla shared the bedroom with Lydia. But, tonight, Priscilla has to sleep
in the guess room alone…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>There
are ups and downs. But we have hope in our Lord. Situations have gone better.
And I have faith the trend will continue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
