</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Last night, mom slept with Lydia on the same bed, since then, Lydia has been breathing fine.  However, since this morning, her oxygen level has been low for a few times.  The last time, we could not get her back.</P>
<P>Lydia passed away in her sleep around 3:30 PM.</P>
<P>The pain and sorrow is beyond I could describe.</P>
<P>We thank the Lord for taking Lydia’s soul.  She is now resting in the Lord.  No more suffering.  Lydia knew that is the best place.</P>
<P>We miss her so much.  We will meet her again in the Lord.</P>
<P>Thank God for the hope and promise.</P>
