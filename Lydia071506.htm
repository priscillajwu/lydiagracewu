</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>These two days, after Lydia came home from hospital, Lydia was not feeling as good as when she was in hospital.</P>
<P>She had good moments and bad ones with one to two hours apart.  Ups and downs, ups and downs, there were too many of them within one day.  Really, it’s no fun to ride roller coaster all day long.</P>
<P>Last night, (one day after her pretty successful chemotherapy hospital stay without any vomiting), she threw up terribly.  She was so uncomfortable.  Mom had to sleep besides her.  Lydia woke up almost every hour, for bathroom, or complaining about her headache, stomach ache, sore leg…  Sleeping quality was not very good.</P>
<P>Exhausted, we had to take easy today and keep our energy for the birthday swimming pool party this evening we planned for Priscilla.  (Priscilla has been complaining lately that nobody cares about her, so we wanted to keep this birthday party although things are very difficult…)</P>
<P>In the afternoon, Lydia developed severe headache, very bad.</P>
<P>&quot;What kind of headache do you feel?&quot; I asked her.</P>
<P>&quot;Like when I was first diagnosed...&quot;  She replied with both eyes close tightly showing how terrible her pain was.</P>
<P>This troubled us a great deal.  I knelt down next to her bed, almost don’t know how to pray with her.  I felt very weak spiritually at that moment.</P>
<P>Only a few hours before the birthday party.  We convinced Lydia to swallow the pain medicine pills.  (She has most medicines in liquid form which can be injected through her feeding tube.  Only a few medicines pills need to go through mouth.)</P>
<P>Later, Lydia was able to go to the swimming pool with us (to cheer up Priscilla and support family event).  She stayed there for about two hours before she felt bad again.  Luckily swimming pool was not far away from home, Mom was able to take her home and had grandparents to watch her.</P>
<P>It was a long day today.  After everybody fell asleep, Mom shared with me her frustration, wondering how Lydia’s sleep tonight would be.</P>
<P>I don’t know.  I can only pray that tonight is a better night.</P>
<P>Truly, situation could get very hard, but thank God, at least, He gave us just enough energy and strength (just enough) to get through it.  I sometimes wanted to have more so I can show that I am strong or boast that things are easy and we can handle it (for my own pride).  But that was not the case.</P>
<P>I think the lesson for me to learn is that, we need to totally trust in the Lord, and rely on Him, and know that He is God.  All we can do is be humble and appreciate what we have.</P>
