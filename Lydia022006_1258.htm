<B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Dear all Prayer Warriors,<BR>
<BR>
(some of you might have received Wu's email)<BR>
<BR>
informed by the oncologist that Lydia may have a tumor left over from last surgery<BR>
<BR>
Although neurosurgeon strongly disagreed with it, but all the radiologist and third party radiologist (second opinion) went along with the same conclusion<BR>
<BR>
will have a special MRI scheduled this Wed, hope to get more information about the suspected tissue<BR>
<BR>
Second surgery is in consideration if MRI result affirms radiologists' opinion <BR>
<BR>
very difficult for Wu's family, specially for Lydia<BR>
<BR>
please keep on praying for her and her family<BR>
<BR>
Only Glory to God who is our Healer<BR>
