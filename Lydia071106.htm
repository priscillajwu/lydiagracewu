</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>It’s second day of this course of chemotherapy.</P>
<P>Lydia has very bad headache and abdominal pain.  So, while chemo medicines were injected, anti-nauseous medicine and painkillers also non-stopped.  We tried to make Lydia as comfortable as possible.</P>
<P>Moreover, the doctor ordered the high dose steroid for her.  It helped.  She all of sudden got good appetite (typical effect of steroid).  However, she also got pretty emotional (maybe still the side effect of steroid).</P>
<P>Today, an ultrasound was performed because of her abdominal pain.  It took a long time, so long that Mom grew suspicious over the reaction of the technician.  They would not say anything, and we need to wait for the doctor to tell us what they found.  Well, well, why worry, everything is in God’s hand, and He has been looking after Lydia all along.  </P>
<P>I know many of you have been sincerely praying for Lydia, please pray for the results of her abdominal ultrasound results.</P>
<P>Our garage door broke tonight while Mom and children got home from hospital.  It’s truly not a good time.  It took a while for them to get into the house.  It’s bit of frustrating.  However, we thank God that both cars were outside of garage, so we still have cars to use tomorrow.  Although the unfortunate things happen, we could always find something good out of it.  God has ways to help us learn the life lessons, grow the faith, and trust in Him.</P>
