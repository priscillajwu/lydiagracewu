</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>I promised Lydia that before her first chemo treatment.  We would take her away from the crowd and stay in the woods for a couple days.  She was very looking forward to it.</P>
<P>Wednesday night’s emergency room stay really got us scared.  But to Lydia’s mind, the most worry she had was that we would not be able to go on vacation.</P>
<P>Thank the Lord, for He has mercy.  We did make it.  We rent a cottage in the woods, and stayed there and enjoyed a retreat.  Lydia had a great time.</P>
<P>She even tried </FONT><A HREF="100_9216.JPG"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>horseback riding</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>, first time in her life riding a horse by herself.  She rode the horse for a full 30 minutes, going through the trails in the woods.</P>
<P>Lydia, my little girl, never stopped amazing me for many surprises.</P>
<P>I praise the Lord for that.</P>
