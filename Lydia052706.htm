</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Several months ago (after Lydia got sick), Lydia was invited to be the flower girl for the loving couple’s wedding (held today) from our church.  Of course, we were overjoyed and prepared the dress and hair wig for Lydia.  We hoped everything would go as planned.  However, until very recently, we were still not for sure that Lydia could be up to the tasks.  Lydia has been having a lot of ups and downs.  Not like in the musical play, she may be able to be excused, but for the flower girl, it has to be her.  If she did not feel good two hours before the wedding, then it would be difficult…</P>
<P>Thank God for giving us faith, including the new couple, and entire wedding team.  When </FONT><A HREF="204_0486.JPG"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>Lydia</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4> walked slowly along the center aisle of the church, it was a tremendous emotional moment for us.  For many (most people attending the wedding), who knew Lydia’s story, had also witnessed God’s healing power and grace.</P>

<P>In the evening, we attended another wedding celebration.  It was an Indian traditional wedding.  Again, it took us a long while to reply the invitation, We just were not sure if we could make it.  There, Lydia enjoyed and </FONT><A HREF="205_0539.JPG"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>danced</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>, and tried Indian food, and shared the happiness from the wedding.</P>

<P>Praise the Lord for He is amazing.</P>
