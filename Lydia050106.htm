</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Today, after missing school for almost three months, Lydia went back to school attending classes for the first time since February 6.  </P>
<P>She spent more than one hour at school.  All the teachers, staffs, and students were very nice and taking precautions.  Every kid was learning how to wash hands correctly.  Lydia had a great time at school.</P>
<P>I was told that the classrooms Lydia would be staying got cleaned up over last several days.  It was lot of efforts from school and we are so thankful.  </P>
<P>We pray that Lydia will be able to attend school part time, not only to learn, but also keep her feeling normal and having good spirit.  And she will continue having home tutor to make up what she has missed.  Thank the Lord for His provision.</P>
