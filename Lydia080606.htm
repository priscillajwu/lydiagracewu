</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Lydia turned ten years old today.</P>
<P>Friends and relatives around the globe were really excited about this day, for we witnessed God’s work on Lydia for the past six months. This is something worthy of celebration. It’s a great accomplishment for Lydia. </P>
<P>Started a few days ago, we received a lot of birthday cards, gifts (many delivered to our house, especially today), phone calls, and emails, wishing Lydia a very happy birthday, hoping to lift up her spirits.</P>
<P>Early in the morning, when Lydia open her eyes, "Happy birthday." We shouted at her in unison. </P>
<P>"I am so sick." Lydia responded. Indeed, last night was a tough night, she woke up many times, moaning and screaming about her headache, nausea, and stomach ache. She soon vomited badly right after.</P>
<P>She was not feeling good at all for the entire day. With a lot of encouragement from mom, she agreed and stopped by the church near the end of worship. Many friends of hers, uncles and aunts, sang happy birthday song to her. Many were surprised to see that she was in terrible condition.</P>
<P>She does not want a birthday party. We understood. She would not have any strength to welcome her friends.</P>
<P>However, gifts and cards, kept coming for Lydia. Our doorbell kept ringing today. Many did not get to see Lydia. She was resting in bed most of the day. However, all her siblings were really excited, whenever the doorbell rang.</P>
<P>Deborah and Priscilla baked birthday cake for Lydia. When cakes and decorations were all ready in the kitchen, it took us more than an hour to wait Lydia to feel a little bit better and convince her to come to the dining table. We thought she did not want to cut the cake, she said she wanted, just too sick to get up from family room sofa.</P>
<P>Finally, she did. A family celebration of her 10<SUP>th</SUP> birthday was held. I was really happy to take </FONT><A HREF="100_0245.JPG"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>the picture</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>. It was a remarkable day. It meant a lot to us.</P>
<P>Lydia really had tough time both physically and spiritually over last week. This birthday weekend seemed to turn the trend up a little bit (I continue pray and hope). We thank God and praise God for his love, through so many people, to love Lydia, pray for her, and have done so much for our family.</P>
<P>We thank you all. While we can not thank all of you one by one, we thank God, for many of you are true blessings to us.</P>
<P>May God bless you all.</P></FONT></BODY>
