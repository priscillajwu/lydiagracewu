<P>Lydia went to school to join the field day event.  Looking at all the healthy boys and girls running, racing, having fun, wow, it is something.</P>
<P>Lydia tried a few races.  She had good time.</P>
<P>On her way out, she noticed all the graduating students had a star (in different colors) hanging from the ceiling of the main aisle in the school.  Lydia tried to look for hers and could not find it.</P>
<P>&quot;Is it because I did not come to school?&quot;  Lydia was disappointed and said sadly.</P>
<P>&quot;Try to look for red color.&quot;  Mom said it because some staffs in school knew Lydia’s favorite color is red.</P>
<P>&quot;How could that be?&quot;  Lydia said, &quot;It’s in all different colors.&quot;</P>
<P>They continued looking for it.</P>
<P>Finally, they found it.  It was in the very front of the row, written &quot;Lydia Wu&quot;, in color </FONT><A HREF="100_8878.JPG"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000">RED</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>.</P>
<P>We realized later that the school staff made that in red on purpose, knowing Lydia’s favorite color is red.  Things like this warmed up our hearts so much…</P>
<P>Thank the Lord.</P>
