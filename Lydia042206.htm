<FONT SIZE=4><P>Our Dear Prayer Partners,</P>
<P>Yesterday was a big milestone for Lydia. She went back to Awana game time. The first time to the Friday Children’s Program since she got sick. It means she was able to participate in the games. We tried to stay in an open area with a nearby door open, which was away from the rest of kids. However, when she really wanted to run the first lap, I let her do it. But she fell down twice in her first attempt because her balance was still not good yet. She was sad. I didn’t want her to just "quit", and think that she couldn’t do it. So I asked the others kids who had run against her to rerun a lap with her. I picked her up, held her hand, and ran with her. She did it. Well, she still fell on the ground at the end of the race.</P>
<P>"Why I can’t run any more?" Lydia asked me later.</P>
<P>"You just need more practice. Your brain needs to get used to all your activities after your big brain surgeries" Mom replied.</P>
<P>It was heartbreaking and very difficult to see her fall down on the ground one time after another. She used to run very fast, even faster than a lot of boys. But I tried to remember that the most important thing isn’t falling, but when you pick yourself up afterward, and keep going.</P>
<P>Lydia fell down at the end of her second race as well, even with me holding her hand.</P>
<P>I was kind of hesitant in letting her run the last game – Marathon (8 laps around the game area). She finished it. </P>
<P>She said, "Mom, I’ve never been so tired after running for 8 laps. But I am feeling so happy."</P>
<P>"Why?"</P>
<P>"I feel like I am normal again!"</P>
<P>Yes, it was good to see that she was feeling good about herself.</P>
<P>For the past two days, she has not been feeling good, and has thrown up a few times. She even threw up on Friday when she was sitting on the radiation treatment table. The Doctor was afraid to treat her that day, because she might throw up again on her mask during the treatment. After cleaning up, she said she would do it. What a brave girl! </P>
<P>Food doesn’t taste good anymore. Please pray for her.</P>
<P>Her ears produce a lot of earwax and fluid. Some bleeding came from the irritated skin inside of her ears. It is another side effect from the radiation treatment. It’s very uncomfortable and annoying.</P>
<P>Even with this whole situation, we have had a really restful day. </P>
