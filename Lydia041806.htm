</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>This is one of those emotionally very difficult nights.</P>
<P>Lydia hid herself in the corner of living room and cried quietly, while nobody noticed for a while. Mom found her, and asked her what’s going on.</P>
<P>She would not answer, I had to pick her up and found out she was crying badly. Then, she started talking with a lot of tears. We were worried since her pulse was so fast, and blood pressure was very low nowadays.</P>
<P>"I felt I am so useless. I used to be able to cover others, help others. Now I need to be taken care…."</P>
<P>"I had the nightmare about getting the cancer before, I never thought I would really get it."</P>
<P>"I am so scared…."</P>
<P>"If the cancer recur, will I need to go through radiation and chemo therapy again?"</P>
<P>"Can I ever swim again when summer comes?</P>
<P>"I am scared I can no longer have normal life again."</P>
<P>"When can we take a trip… can I do it?"</P>
<P>She said so much, with non-stopping crying. Her skin around the eyes got so red (her skin is very sensitive now). </P>
<P>It was very difficult for all of us. Mom, Dad, and Esther tried to comfort her. Deborah and Priscilla kept quiet nearby.</P>
<P>Emotional pain and suffering sometimes were worse than physical. With hope in God is the only thing which can comfort us.</P>
<P>After probably an hour, Lydia finally felt better and said, "God has all of these planned years ago, right?"</P>
<P>"Actually He knew it before you were even born." Mom said.</P>
<P>Lydia finally smiled. It’s a great comfort knowing that our heavenly father is looking after us very closely…</P>
