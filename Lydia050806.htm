<div class=Section1>

<p><span style='font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Arial'>May 8, 2006, Monday<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia did not go to school
today, and stuck at home for the entire day. After I came back from work, I saw
her face really pale. So, I dragged her out to go to Costco for grocery
shopping, thinking at least she could get some walking and exercise a little
bit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>At Costco, I bought two
churros (the sweet cinnamon twist), one for mom and one for Lydia. (Usually we
don’t get those. Only at special occasions and it’s a special treat.) So when I
handed the churros to Lydia. She was really happy. Several minutes later, mom
already finished hers for a while. Lydia still had a long piece, almost the
same length of original. Although she pretended that she still enjoyed it, and
continued eating it (very small tiny bites each time). I knew she could not eat
and had hard time to swallow. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>It’s so frustrating. How
can I get her to eat? I though she would like it...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>At night, when I
accompanied Lydia while mom is sorting through the super thick stack of hospital
bills, Lydia said,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;I wish I can gain
weight, back to my original weight before the chemo therapy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;But you are not
eating enough.&quot; I said, &quot;Besides, you only got three weeks to
go.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;I know it’s hard. But
I really want to.&quot; Lydia said wishfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia told me that
Priscilla is already several pounds heavier than her. It was just the opposite
only a few months ago. I can see that being lighter than her younger sister is
not something pleasant to Lydia. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>I really need to pray hard
for Lydia to gain some strength and weight and eat more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Before Lydia went to take
shower, she almost forgot she still have the hat on. She said,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;The hat is like my
hair.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;I can see that and
feel the same way since I don’t have hair either.&quot; I said while rubbing my
bald head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;I don’t know why did
you do that.&quot; Lydia said with smile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Why I shaved my head?
Don’t you like it! How about I grow it back?&quot; I said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;No, you can wait
until my chemo therapies finish.&quot; Lydia laughed louder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Like father like daughter.
It’s the rare occasion that father and daughter could have the same hair style.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Thank the Lord for that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
