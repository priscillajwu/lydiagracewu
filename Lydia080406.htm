</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Lydia continued having severe headache and stomach ache, and not any better (if not worse than) yesterday.  We were waiting for any new plan from the doctors.  Well, toward the end of the day, they still suggested anti-depressant.  It’s up to us to take it or not.</P>
<P>Without a lot of prayers, we have decided not to take the option.  We requested to go home, and celebrate Lydia’s birthday at home, not in the hospital.  We will try our best to cheer her up over the weekend and hope to break her headache pattern (since it’s tension related) without the medication.</P>
<P>It was a big leap of faith for Lydia to agree to go home.  She is under tremendous discomfort and suffering.  Without feeling better, she agreed to go home with us.  Thank God for that.</P>
<P>Indeed, Lydia has strong faith.  I reminded her that during radiation therapy, similar situation, while all the pain medicines had no effect.  With prayer and the faith, the pain pattern could be broken.  She was the one who has to face it and work it out.</P>
<P>Lydia came home in the evening, and felt very weak.  She has decided not to go to Columbus tomorrow.  Although she really wanted to attend the Ohio State spelling bee competition, she just could not do it.  She could hardly walk with balance.</P>
<P>We pray to the Lord that we could have easy, relaxing, and joyful weekend for Lydia.  Then, get ready for next week’s third chemotherapy.</P>
