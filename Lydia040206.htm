<P>Dear prayer partners,</P>

<P>Your prayers work!!</P>
<P>Lydia has cut down her pain medicines since Friday night!</P>
<P>Friday night, Lydia woke up a few times but she didn’t get up to use restroom or take any pain pills. She said that she knew that I am a light sleeper, and since I was sleeping in her room for the first time after she has been sick, she tried not to wake me up during the night. What a sweet girl! </P>

<P>Last night, she woke up once to use restroom, because her belly was hurting.</P>
<P>Her belly or stomach has been hurting these days. Please pray about it.</P>

<P>She keeps telling me her stomach, throat, and whole head are hurting. Her whole body is not feeling good. She cried this morning after Daddy and her sisters left for the church services. She wished that her pain would go away, and that she could feel normal again. We spent some time talking about her feelings and frustration. When she cried, I couldn’t help but cry with her. </P>
<P>&quot;Mom, when is this going to end?&quot; Lydia asked me. &quot;After your treatments are done, you will feel all better.&quot; I answered. </P>
<P>I reminded her, &quot;God has promised us that you will be completely healed, it is just a matter of time. We can’t focus on today, or tomorrow. We can only put our eyes upon God and think of the years after all of this finishes.&quot;</P>
<P>It’s not easy for me to ask a 9 years old kid to keep her eyes on the future instead of right now. But it seemed God did comfort her.</P>

<P>Lydia complained that her fingers feel numb and weird. We pray that it won’t be permanent damage.</P>

<P>Today is the last day of Spring Break. Lydia’s sisters will go back to school. It has been a wonderful and fun week for Lydia since all her sisters were home with her. Pray for her adjustment. </P>
<P>Please also pray that Lydia can have more energy to do more things she likes to do. </P>

<P>Thank you!</P>

<P>In Him,</P>
<P>Jean</P></FONT></BODY>
