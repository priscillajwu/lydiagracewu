</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Lydia joined the research project display today. The topic was "Far Far Away". She picked </FONT><A HREF="100_8680.JPG"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>Israel</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>, because grandma visited not long ago and had first hand information. She spent a lot of time doing it. She was under some stress recently that she would not be able to finish it. Praise the Lord, she made it.</P>
<P>Today was also the first day of summer swimming season practice. She has been waiting for this day to arrive. Lydia wanted to do it so much. Nobody is sure about it, even herself. She asked Mom, "Would I ever be able to swim again?"</P>
<P>With tears, Mom said, "Let’s try and see."</P>
<P>Thank God, today is warm enough. </FONT><A HREF="100_8685.JPG"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>Lydia</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4> got into the water and, yes, swam. She tried free style, breast stroke, back stroke, and even butterfly. She was so tired after one lap of butterfly. And she got out of water immediately after it. Although she was only in the water for several minutes. She was really happy. We praise the Lord.</P>
<P>In the evening, she participated a wedding rehearsal, she will be the flower girl this Saturday.</P>
<P>It’s a busy day for her. We thanked the Lord for everything.</P></FONT></BODY>
