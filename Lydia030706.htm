<p><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>March

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>My dear prayer heroes,</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Please pray for Lydia. She
will have CT scan tomorrow (3/8) at University hospital. That is for the
preparation of radiation therapy.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>On Thurday, after clinic
appointment with oncologist, Lydia will undergo two operations. The first is to
puncture her spinal cord to draw spinal fluid for the lab to make sure there is
no spread to the spinal. The second is a surgery to insert a port in her upper
left chest. The port will connect to the vein next to the heart, and it's for
the purpose of chemotherapy.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>We were told that several
of Lydia's 4th grade friends would get together during lunch time at school.
They would hold hands and pray for Lydia. It must have been a beautiful scene.
Praise the Lord.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia's school teacher, a
very nice Christian sister, visited her today. They talked for almost two
hours, a lot about school. I am sure Lydia missed school very much...</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>When sisters came home from
school, or music lessons, or sports lessons. Lydia would listen to what
happened and laugh with them. I felt very sad for her. She has lost just about
everything, not able to go to school or any other activities, only pain and
suffering, and countless hospital visits. But she seems to be all right. All I
can say is praise the Lord. It has to be the comforts from our Lord, and
prayers of many.....</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>In Him,</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Simon <o:p></o:p></span></p>
