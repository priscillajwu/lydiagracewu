<P>After today’s radiation, around 11 AM, Lydia had very bad stomachache.  She lay on the hospital bed moaning without much of strength.</P>
<P>Her doctor was troubled and ordered IV liquid right away.  Blood sample was quickly withdrawn and sent to lab for immediate lab work.</P>
<P>We had to pray hard in the hospital, and keep our belief in God’s promise from last several days that God will help us to reduce Lydia’s suffering, although radiation treatment continues everyday…</P>
<P>Around noon, miraculously, she felt better, and sat up, ate her lunch...  Doctor came back and was surprised to see she is doing so well.</P>
<P>We went home not long after it, (We were afraid we would be stuck in the hospital again today.) leaving the IV behind, untouched.</P>
<P>We also brought home a device, which could relieve her headache and stomachache.  This device vibrates mildly.  Two pads attach to her back neck or abdomen area.  Lydia liked it a lot.  In my opinion, it’s better than pain medications.  Praise the Lord.</P>
<P>The blood results did show that Lydia’s white blood cell count is critically low (lowest ever, so far).  I guess that is typical while going through the treatment.  We need to start wear mask when going outside or when friends visit.</P>
<P>Tonight, we enjoyed the music with all four girls </FONT><A HREF="100_7799.JPG"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>playing hymns</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4> with their instruments.  It’s so joyful to praise the Lord.  The Holy Spirit brought a lot of peace and joy to our hearts.</P>

<P>Please pray for the next MRI, which is scheduled next Tuesday, April 11.  We pray for God’s healing…</P>
