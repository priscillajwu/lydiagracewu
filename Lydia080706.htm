</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Lydia continued receiving quite a few birthday cards today, wishing her very happy birthday.</P>
<P>While going through cards with her.  I was shocked to find out that she was not able to read clearly.  Her vision started to get bad…  I asked her what’s going on and demanded her to read again.  She would get serious headache if I kept asking her.</P>
<P>Just recent days, Lydia was not able to stand or walk without somebody holding her.  She hands shake terribly like a heavy drunkard.  Her eyes half open even when she is full awake.  My heart aches extremely just to look at her walking.  It’s hard to imagine that, only a week ago, she swam for the full 50 yards backstroke in the championship swim meet.</P>
<P>In the evening, while Esther and Deborah paired up to play tennis, Priscilla would like somebody to play with her.  She wanted Lydia.  But how could Lydia do it.  She could not even stand up.  At the end, they came up with a good idea, and I helped them to set it up.  Lydia sat in the courts, and threw the tennis ball to feed Priscilla to hit the ball.  When I took </FONT><A HREF="100_0255.JPG"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>the shot</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>, I probably smiled, but deep in my heart, I was crying badly.</P>

<P>Some brothers and sisters in the Lord had raised the doubt to us whether chemotherapy should continue especially two MRI have shown pretty good results, and Lydia was under so much suffering.</P>
<P>To tell the truth, we don’t know, and we are under a lot of stress too.</P>
<P>I asked Lydia, if she wanted to continue next chemotherapy, she said yes, because she wants to get better, and totally healed.</P>
<P>We have prayed very hard tonight, the entire family.  When you read this, please pray for Lydia also.  Tomorrow, we will go to hospital to get third chemotherapy as scheduled.  We cast everything in God’s hand.  Lord Jesus Christ will watch over Lydia, and we should not fear.  Whatever happens tomorrow, God is in control.  We pray that God gives the wisdom to the doctors, and us so that Lydia would get the best care under God’s will.</P>
