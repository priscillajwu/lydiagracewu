</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Today is the day that for whatever reason, everybody needs a piece out of Mom.  All need Mom’s attention for something.  How much Mom could do for them was really depending on Lydia’s condition.  And actually, once Lydia is feeling good for an hour or so, then mom needs to rush out to get some groceries.  Her time got very fragmented.</P>
<P>Later in the day, Lydia asked mom to help her doing something.  It was not terribly urgent.  Mom told Lydia could she wait or not doing it, while Mom was busy with the siblings.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, I am sorry, I shouldn’t even ask for that.&quot;  Lydia said sadly. (If she was not sick, she could have done it by herself.)</P>
<P>And that made mom sad and felt terrible and guilty.</P>
<P>Today was the day that Mom was short of temper and very frustrated.  She even tried to write today’s update.  When almost finished, she went away to do something, and did not save the file.  Then, the entire file was gone for whatever reason (she could not recall what happened to the computer).  Talking about frustration.  This was the example.</P>
<P>I asked her, isn’t the similar situation like today happened once a while, even before Lydia was sick.</P>
<P>Well, there are differences.  Lydia continues suffering from her headaches and terrible nausea, especially in the morning.  We hope that is because of the chemotherapy.  We have MRI next Monday.  We put that in prayer and ask for God’s comfort and peace in our hearts.</P>
<P>Lydia also has other discomforts, from her ears, blood pressure, pulse, and breathing difficulties.  Some of the symptom could not be taken lightly, before it becomes permanent damaged.</P>
<P>Lydia continues not eating much.  Only a few medicine pills (most her medicines were liquid and can be injected directly to her belly) was swallowed through her mouth today, and a few sips of water, of course.  And because of her abdominal pain, the tube feeding has to go very slowly.  She has lost weight sharply just these few days after she came home from chemotherapy.  People said that is OK and typical for chemo patients.  Easy to say, hard to deal with it.</P>
<P>My mother called today from Taiwan and asked why don’t we prepare whatever Lydia like for her to eat.  I told her, nothing, nothing, she would not eat anything, not even candy, not even ice cream, nothing.  She seems to have hard time to believe me.  Nor would I, unless I am witnessing it myself.</P>
<P>Well, enough hardship, time to pray for God’s help.  I still deeply believe that God is in control, and our loving God has good plan for us.  I just need to have patience and take it day by day, and be sure to learn the lesson from it.</P>
<P>For that, again, I thank God and praise God.</P>
