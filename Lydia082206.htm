</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>&quot;I am looking for a place to bury my 10 years old daughter.  She passed away yesterday afternoon.&quot;  I did not know how I looked or sounded when I explained why we were in the office of the cemetery.</P>
<P>They looked at me with a look of disbelief.  &quot;I am so sorry.&quot; &quot;It must be really hard.&quot; &quot;I don’t know how you handle it.&quot;…</P>
<P>I wondered why they would say that.  Aren’t they professional.  Don’t they deal with people like me in a daily basis?</P>
<P>Later, I realized the customer like me is not very frequent for them.  Most of people died at old age.</P>

<P>This is another tough day for us.  We went to the funeral home to plan the funeral.  I was so unwilling to talk about those things.  My brain was not function well.  And I was shocked about how costly it is.  With the same amount of money, I could buy Lydia a lot of stuff, and send her to learn all kinds of music or sports lessons she wants for years, or send her to college, if she were still alive.</P>

<P>We got to see Lydia’s body again.  She still looked so beautiful and peaceful.  Her skin is pale and cold.  Both mom and I cried uncontrollably.  I have to keep reminding mom that Lydia was not there.  She is with the Lord now.  This is only her earthly body.  Really, I could not think of anything worse in life to bury our own child.</P>

<P>I have cried too much today, even in front of strangers.  We went to a restaurant for lunch between the cemetery visits.  When the waiter asked me how many in the party.  When I count, I simply choked up, because I still used to count four children.  Now, I have three…  Where is Lydia?  Oh Lord, it’s so hard.  I don’t know when can I get used to.</P>

<P>We looked through Lydia’s pictures since she was born.  We wanted to pick some pictures to show in her funeral service.  It was too difficult.  It’s another thing I didn’t want to do but I had to do.  It’s not only suffering, it’s almost like torture to myself.</P>

<P>I had hard time to write yesterday and today’s prayer letters.  Please pray for us.  We need to decide which cemetery to bury Lydia tomorrow.  As usual, it’s not easy to make decision among all the family members, especially we were trying to guess what Lydia would pick.  There are still many things to decide, and many things to work out.  And time is so little…</P>

<P>Oh, Lord, please help us so that what we do or plan for the funeral in the next several days will please you and glorify your name.  And that is exactly what Lydia would like.</P>

<P>By the way, mom thought it over back and forth about last several days.  She is now pretty sure what were Lydia’s last words.  Lydia said it last Thursday morning.  Mom will share what those words were in Lydia’s memorial service.</P>
