</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Lydia had hospital check up today.  Her blood counts were pretty low, as expected for the second week of chemotherapy.  That means she needs to stay home as much as possible, although her siblings are having fun attending summer camp and swim meets.  With Mom’s whole attention, she seems doing all right that none of the siblings were home today.</P>
<P>The trip back home from hospital today took three times longer than usual, because of the terrible traffic jam on the high way.  It was a very difficult ride for Lydia.  She felt very nauseous, and slow car speed with a lot of stop-and-go made situation even worse.  Only Mom and Lydia were in the car, and Mom had to drive, so Lydia had to suffer in the back by herself holding a bucket.  The ride seemed to be forever for them.</P>
<P>Lydia had hard time to play piano or cello recently.  We did not know whether it’s because the damage of the chemotherapy to her mobility, or she is just too weak to do any activities.  But no matter what, she needs to play the instruments or other activities as the physical therapy according to the therapist.</P>
<P>Tonight, Lydia prayed to God for the help, and the strength.  Apparently she was very frustrated too.  The tears she shed while trying to play the music piece she used to be able to play easily, but not able to now, made mom very sad too.  She seems to lose the strength of her fingers and body motions very noticeably.</P>
<P>Please continue praying for her, and thank you for the labor of prayers in the Lord, Christ Jesus.</P>
