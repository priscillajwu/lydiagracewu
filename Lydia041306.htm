<P>Today, Lydia had regular clinic check up. All her doctors were really happy about the MRI results from Tuesday. Both tumors have reduced the sizes. Her mobility continues to be very good. Praise the Lord.</P>
<P>Lydia prepared a bag full of gifts and goodies, and brought it to the hospital. She put a lot of stuff in it, crafts, candies, purse, little ornaments… She gave to the hospital staff and wanted them to give to a real sick child who were from out of town, away from home, stayed in the hospital, and not able to go home for the Easter. They found a girl, who is also nine years old. We were not sure exactly her illness is (we did not know who she was, and she did not know who we were either). According to the staff, that girl patient was very upset about not able to go home, but after received the gift, she said she is OK with it now.</P>
<P>Lydia smiled widely when she heard that. She wanted to let that girl know that God loves her…</P>
<P>Lydia’s blood count continues to drop, critically low low. Her weight also continues to drop, almost a pound a week. She is barely 50 pounds. Almost 10 pound less than before. We pray that she can eat more and gain weight.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Happy Easter!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In Him,</P>
<P>Simon</P>
