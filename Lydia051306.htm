<FONT SIZE=4><P>Dear Friends,</P>

<P>&#9;&quot;Whoo! Good job! High Five!&quot; I smiled broadly as my school friends cheered enthusiastically as Lydia walked by. She was walking the Survivor Lap, the lap that signals the beginning of Relay for Life. Relay for Life is an activity that is sponsored by the American Cancer Society. It takes place in hundreds of locations across the United States. Relay for Life honors the many that have died from cancer, and the many that have survived it and those that are still fighting everyday. </P>
<P>&#9;I signed Lydia and my family up to attend the event, praying that she’d feel up to the occasion. Thankfully, she felt well enough, and yesterday our entire family headed out to Relay for Life. At the dinner before the relay started, we met many other cancer survivors. To my surprise, there was quite a few of them. Truly, we are not alone in our struggle.</P>
<P>&#9;During the Survivor Lap, my family and I walked alongside Lydia as she walked with the rest of the survivors once around the track. The other participants of the relay stood alongside the track cheering at the top of their lungs. Each teenager standing on the edge of the track was so energetic in cheering for the survivors, and congratulating them. I was amazed and deeply touched by this display of kindness and care. </P>
<P>&#9;The highlight of the event however, was the Luminaria ceremony. A luminary is a paper bag that contains a burning candle, which honors individual cancer survivors and victims. Although I had sent in an order for 40 luminaries, only 13 were made. However, the officials allowed Lydia to make more bags. I watched as she happily wrote &quot;Lydia Grace Wu&quot; on bag after bag. Later on, it was I that had to fill the bags will sand and a candle, back breaking work, but absolutely worth it. Again I watched with a smile on my face as Lydia excitedly placed the bags where she wanted them around the track. She carefully and happily checked each of the bags to make sure the candle was standing up straight. Looking at the </FONT><A HREF="100_8584.JPG"><FONT SIZE=4>61 bags</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4> with her name on them was truly amazing. Then, as the candles were lit, the stadium lights were turned off. All that lit the track were the candles, and it was a breathtaking sight. Officials read off hundreds of names of those who had suffered from cancer. Silence fell on the participants as they walked around the track honoring each cancer victim and survivor. </P>
<P>&#9;As I looked around the stadium, it struck me just how many luminaries there were. Although every day I feel like Lydia’s life is so difficult, every person with a luminary had gone through the same pain and suffering. The same hardship. The meaning of the event really struck me at that moment. <I>Finding a cure for cancer.</I> Because no one deserves cancer, no one should have to deal with the difficulties and impossibilities of it. That’s why I relay, that’s why the hundreds of participants there raised money for this cause. Tears flowed down my face as I cried out of the sadness of dealing with Lydia’s brain tumor, and sorrow, that so many have had to deal with this life-changing experience. There was a barely a dry eye as my friends gathered around my family and I, hugging my sisters and me, and telling stories about their own loved ones affected by cancer. My friends prayed with our family as my dad and I prayed for Lydia and all the others affected by cancer. Quiet sobs made beautiful background music as we prayed. Even in my grief, I felt so supported, and my heart felt like it would burst with love for those around me. Cancer is such a difficult experience for all that have the misfortune of meeting it head on. Yet with the support of a loving God, and loving family and friends, things truly look better. I thank God for this amazing opportunity to participate in the relay, and I thank Him, from the bottom of my heart for the friends and family that He’s blessed Lydia and our entire family with.</P>

<P>Love,</P>
