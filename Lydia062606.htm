</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P>&#9;Another one of the countless hospital visits, this morning, we were back to hospital for various check up, hearing test, kidney function test (this was a long and tedious one, requiring multiple blood samples within hours), and, another blood count test.</P>
<P>&#9;We were rushing in and out, back and forth, among departments in Children’s hospital. For whatever reason, all the appointments were scheduled so close. We thought it would save time, well, at the end, we were not sure.</P>
<P>&#9;Lydia could not walk fast today, her bone joints hurt a lot because of one of the medication. To speed up and catch the next appointment, I piggybacked her running around in the hospital. We thought about using wheel chair, but that is not fast enough (difficult to get in and out of elevator). Anyway, it seemed to be a bit of more fun for Lydia to ride on my back than the wheel chair.</P>
<P>&#9;Last Saturday her blood count has already started to climb up, so we expected today’s blood results should be somewhat higher. Well, not the case, her blood count has gone lower. Mom was very very disappointed (she was quite exhausted for last two weeks). I was afraid we would get stuck in the hospital again for her low level of blood count. Luckily, the doctor on duty today, (our doctor was on vacation), let us go home.</P>
<P>&#9;So, no relief yet, still need to continue closely watch her, although we were told two weeks after chemotherapy, she should start to catch up. Guess not. If her blood counts do not increase, the second chemotherapy would have to delay.</P>
<P>&#9;Last week, when Lydia was really sick, seeing lighting bugs flying around through the window, she asked Mom, "Would I be able to catch the lighting bug again?" This kind of question always got Mom choked up.</P>
<P>&#9;With God’s grace, she was able to do it this evening. It made her really happy, she was able to do get out of the house, and chase after the lighting bugs, just like we always did every summer.</P>
