<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P>August, 9, 2006, Wednesday</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Spinal MRI this morning showed cancer cells already spread extensively in the spinal cord.</P>
<P>The surgery is not an option because of the extent of cancer spread. It’s all over the place in her brain and spinal cord. Lydia already had her full dose radiation, could not have any more, besides that did not stop the current cancer spread.</P>
<P>Thank you for your prayers, the doctors were able to come up with the new chemotherapy quickly with consultation with a few other Children hospitals. (the original chemotherapy apparently did not work.) We started this chemotherapy today. Please pray that this new chemotherapy can kill the cancer cells effectively and quickly. It’s very very critical and urgent now.</P>
<P>Because Lydia is losing her physical (neurological) functions very rapidly. Not only not able to walk normally, her hands coordination has gone very bad (she must be extremely frustrating). Her mouth was not able to contain water or any liquid because her lips function has gone bad. She also lost a lot of her left eye sight. She also could not close her right eye. All of these can be permanent damages. Mom cried and cried uncontrollably for knowing all of these. For only a few days, there are so many dramatic damages to her resulted from the cancer cells, way beyond we could handle. It’s so bad and unbearable.</P>
<P>It’s very difficult for us these two days. We have shed a lot of tears. Our hearts ache terribly. My heart is so heavy. It feels like my heart is pressing my stomach and making my stomach very upset.</P>
<P>But we know our God listens to the prayers of His children. We ask for His mercy and grace, healing power and miracle for Lydia.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&quot;Why do you look so worried?&quot;  Lydia asked Mom today.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, probably I do not have enough faith.&quot;  Mom responded.</P>
<P>&quot;I am not worry, I know I will get better.&quot;  Lydia said, &quot;It’s just going to be hard.&quot;</P>
<P>This is the faith of a ten years old child.  Let’s all learn from Lydia and pray for her.</P></FONT></BODY>
