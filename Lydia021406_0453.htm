<BR>
4:30pm ET<BR>
<BR>
Lydia's physical and occupational therapies continue everyday. It may take time to clear away pain, dizziness, and double vision. But, she is making progress. Let's give thanks and praises to God for that.<BR>
<BR>
So far, the conference with docs has not been held yet. We don't know what the future plan is. <BR>
<BR>
It is now for her good if you can hold your visitation due to her physical strength. If you really want to visit her, make sure she is not in sleep before you enter the room, because she's been suffering the pains and didn't have enough sleep.<BR>
<BR>
Again, please keep praying for her and her family. Thank you.<BR>
<BR>
May God bless you all<BR>
