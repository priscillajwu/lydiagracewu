dear prayer heroes,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Now,
Lydia has another tumor, the location is inoperable according to the
neurosurgeon. So, no surgery is planned. The radiation dose will be increased
and lengthened. The side effects and permanent damages could be exponentially
more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Although
situation is very tough, God has told us not to be scared. (Joshua 1:9) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Please
continue praying for Lydia. Apparently, God has allowed all of these to happen.
May God’s name be glorified. He has the healing power. He is in control of
everything, and He is our God, our Lord, and He has mercy and grace. I have no
reason not to believe God is going to help us, He is going to heal Lydia, and
He is going to use Lydia for the great testimony of His wondrous acts. Most
importantly, lift up our faith. He is our true father, nothing under the sun
can be relied on or depended on, only our Lord, Christ Jesus.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia
continued having severe pain. The steroid and pain medicines are closely taken
and controlled. The IV liquid made Lydia needed to go to restroom every one to
two hours. When I watched Lydia overnight at hospital. I could get up and help
her to restroom, then I came back, and I could fall asleep within minutes. Mom
could not. So, she has trained Lydia to go to restroom by herself. Lydia would
get up in the middle of night, by herself, unplug the IV, and pushed the IV (which
is a lot taller than her) and slowly walked to the restroom, urinated, washed
hand, and then slowly walked back, plugged the IV, climbed back to her bed, and
tried to go back to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>I
saw it tonight, a small body, pushed the IV, and slowly (making sure the tubes
are not tangled) walked to the restroom…., nicely and quietly. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It’s very cute <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>It also made me cry…. Truly, it’s hard to watch. Either I jumped
to help her, or just don’t look….<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Thank
the Lord and praise the Lord that Lydia is a strong girl. Let’s continue
praying for her. Let’s have faith in our Lord, and thank you very much for
keeping her in your prayers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
