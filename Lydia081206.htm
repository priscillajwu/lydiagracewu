</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Thank you for your prayers, Lydia’s neurological deterioration seemed slow down a little bit today.</P>
<P>What happened last several days was like a negative &quot;miracle&quot;.  A real bad one.  It was beyond my imagination or comprehension.  Things just got worse too rapidly.  It did not make any sense at all.  It almost like what happened to Job in the Bible.  Suddenly happened, and hit very hard.</P>
<P>However, our Lord is alive.  He is our deliverer, our Savior.  We continue pray that the new chemo drugs are effective to stop the spread and kill the cancer cells.</P>
<P>We again have a lot of visitors today.  Some visitors got to see Lydia today, and prayed with her.  She liked it very much.  She would say multiple thanks and that she needed the prayer.</P>
<P>This morning, Lydia spent a crazy three hours just to urinate.  It’s so difficult for her.  Again, she doesn’t want to have the bladder tube.  She wants to do it by herself.  (Of course, whoever came in the morning to visit her did not get to see her.)</P>
<P>She might have false feeling (because of tumor) that she needs to go to bathroom that often (less than an hour from last urination, she would need to go again).  However, she is not drinking or eating anything.  All the nutrition and fluid are through IV.  So, it’s very regulated.  She only needs to go to bathroom every several hours.  Mom came up a way, two hours interval is minimal before she could go urinating again.  When she had more urine in her bladder, she would have easier time to urinate.</P>
<P>In the evening, after I took Lydia’s siblings home, while Lydia seemed asleep, mom went out to get something from refrigerator (only a few minutes).  That was probably the first time in last several days that Lydia was alone.  Mom came back only found that Lydia was on the floor.  Then, we realized that Lydia wanted to go bathroom by herself and tried.  Poor Lydia, she thought she could do it, not knowing that her legs had become too weak.  With this incident, we again, realized how strong and determined this girl is, amazingly beyond an adult like myself.</P>
<P>She is so determined to get well.  She wants to do things by herself.  With such a storm facing her, she seems not afraid and ready to fight the battle.</P>
<P>I deeply believe that her faith and determination will help her greatly to fight the disease.</P>
<P>Prayer worriers, please pray for her.  Our God listens to our prayers.</P>
<P>May all the glory go to our heavy father, Lord Jesus.</P>
