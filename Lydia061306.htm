</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Ever since chemotherapy started yesterday, Lydia has been urinating every 15 to 20 minutes. Therefore, she did not have much sleep since yesterday.</P>
<P>Today, her nausea got much worse. Although we got all the anti-nauseous medicines to her, she is still feeling very nauseous.</P>
<P>At night, I spent hours to feed her, little by little, sip by sip. Then, she threw up everything. Not giving up, we tried again, I took a few hours to get her eat something, several small bites of chicken, some potato, and drank some soda. I stood on her bedside, with food on my hand.  She ate very very slow.  Then, all of sudden, she threw up all of them again…</P>
<P>Lydia kept saying sorry that she did not do it on purpose.</P>
<P>"It’s OK. It’s not your fault." I said with a deep sadness in my heart.</P>
<P>My heart aches seeing her under so much suffering.</P>
<P>Lydia lost almost another pound since yesterday.</P>
<P>We knew the chemotherapy might be difficult. Now we are experiencing it, it’s hard to describe the level of frustration and sorrow.</P>
<P>Please pray for the doctors so they have wisdom and know how to get Lydia’s conditions under control as soon as possible.</P>
<P>We need the strength from the Lord. May God’s mercy and grace be upon us.</P></FONT></BODY>
