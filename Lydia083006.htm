<p><span style='font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Arial'>August 30, 2006, Wednesday<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Compared with yesterday,
for whatever reason, mom had much harder time to get through today. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>I guess I never expected
that life would be this difficult after Lydia passed away. We miss her so much.
We woke up in the morning thinking of her. Throughout the day, Lydia is
constantly in our minds. At night, we could not sleep because our minds were
full of many things about her. However, weeping badly (mom and dad together
with door closed) did help us to fall asleep eventually.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>I believe God will continue
help to get us through. The Lord did carry us through the last two weeks of
Lydia’s life on earth. It was so difficult back then. We fast, prayed, and
cried. It seemed impossible to get through each day then. But with God’s help,
we did make through it. I do not know how long the grieving will be. I’d better
hold on to the Lord tightly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>While I am hoping things
could slow down a little bit, the world is still going on its own speed. It takes
extra effort from me to catch up. Sometimes, it’s hard for me to breathe, I had
to remind myself to breathe. Otherwise I may stop breathing for something
invisible is pressing me very heavy. Reluctantly, I realized that life goes on
outside the windows.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>There was an open house of
Deborah’s junior high school today. Originally, both mom and dad planned to
attend. But, mom just could not make it. She was not feeling well emotionally
and physically. When I was there, surrounded by many happy and excited parents,
I did not feel easy being there. However, I had to do what I need to do. I made
sure all Deborah’s teachers knew what happened recently (actually they already
knew). They all thought Deborah have been doing fine so far. Praise the Lord.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>I also felt sad that since
several years ago, we realized that this year and next year, we would have four
kids in four schools (high, junior high, middle, and elementary schools). We
were going to be busy hopping around schools. We were eager for this year to
arrive. Well, obviously, God thought four schools are too much for us. We could
only have three schools like previous years. No need to worry about the middle
school, since Lydia did not have opportunity to attend it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Most people do not like
being around with people who grieve all day long. The world today has very
little patience for people who mourn. The best comfort I could find is in the
Lord Jesus (Matthew 5:4), the body of Christ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Thank you very much for your prayers and supports.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
