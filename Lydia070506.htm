</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Today, Lydia took her first cello lesson in five months. She was probably pretty rusty. However, her cello teacher was amazed how much she could do. Lydia and teacher played duet at the end of lesson. It was so beautiful. Mom got so emotional while video taping it… (Because just a few days ago we learned that Lydia has lost her reflex due to the chemotherapy).</P>
<P>Today, it’s another difficult day filled with hardships shared by Lydia’s three siblings. It’s very difficult for all of them physically and emotionally. Our hearts broke while listening to them. As the parents, other than try our best to go on, we continue praying for God’s mercy and grace…</P>
<P>I am almost for certain there will be more challenges in front of us. However, I should not fear.</P>

<P>After all, we are truly blessed being the children of God, with salvation from our savior, Christ Jesus.</P></FONT></BODY>
