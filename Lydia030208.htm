Friend,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'><span style='font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Another year has passed. It’s been a year and a half
since my darling little sister, Lydia passed away. It may or may not surprise
you that it doesn’t get easier. In fact, in many ways it’s harder. People have
started to forget, thinking that enough time has passed. But it’s comforting to
know that she still lives on in memories of many others. And so she lives on.
Her story continues. I have also been remembering her in my own ways. The
influence she’s left on me manifests itself in my writing and most recently, in
my art. I drew a <a href="S6301393.JPG">portrait of her</a> in my art class
last semester and it was displayed in our district art show this past weekend.
It was a way for me to remember my sister. To see her smiling face every day as
I struggled to portray her in a way that did her beautiful countenance justice.
One day I asked my mother to come see the finished product at school, not
telling her what I had drawn. She was stunned, and then tears began rolling
down her face as she whispered how much it looked like her. Later on, others
told me that the portrait had a bit of a resemblance to me as well. I wouldn’t
be surprised. Lydia has become an inseparable part of me, of everything I do. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>As I went to visit my art in the show, I saw three
young girls gathered around it. As I approached them, I heard one asking
another, “When did she die?” I didn’t recognize any of the girls, yet somehow
they knew Lydia’s story. It only showed me once again that Lydia’s story would
not be forgotten. It will be spread…for the nations to hear. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Her legacy continues in this event, Relay for Life,
as well. She herself was only able to attend one year, but I remember her glee
as she walked among the lit up Luminaria bags donated in honor of her name. The
next year, the number of bags had doubled, but she wasn’t there walking among
them. Last year’s Relay was our first without Lydia. And it was so hard. But
there were many to share in our grief. The first half of our Luminaria ceremony
that I had worked so hard to prepare was dedicated to Lydia, our Hero. All the
participants of the event sat to watch a PowerPoint of Lydia’s life, her
struggle, and her ultimate death. Pain wracked my body as I was once again
reminded of my sister’s undeserved hardships. But as tears streamed down my
face, I realized that many of the faces that surrounded me were also very wet.
Many of whom I didn’t even know. (<a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Lydia’s
story had touched the crowd, her courage, her faith, her hope, and her love. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Though I know that the donations made now no longer
affect Lydia, I still have faith that a cure will be found for all of those
currently fighting cancer. One of these fighters is my best friend’s older
brother, Miguel de Vela. Miguel was diagnosed with the exact same brain tumor
that Lydia had when he was merely seven years old. He went into remission, but
then had a relapse. He has had numerous surgeries and is in and out of the
hospital all of the time. Miguel is now 21 and is still fighting and struggling
against the effects of the disease every day. My heart goes out to their family
because I know how hard it is. And how brave they have to be in the face of
this ongoing challenge. It’s hard to realize that there are so many families
fighting with cancer, and I relay in hopes that a cure will be found. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>I write this letter to you today to ask you to join
me in supporting the cause that Relay for Life works for, the finding of
cancer’s cure. I’ve made Relay for Life my annual way to remember my little
sister. I write in hopes that you will do the same. I hope that you will support
me in my goal to make this year better than ever. I pray that Lydia’s legacy
can continue through this event, and that we can also support the multitudes
that are and will be fighting cancer in their lives. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
