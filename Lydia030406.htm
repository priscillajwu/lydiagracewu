<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>In the morning, we had
trouble to figure out tomorrow’s schedule. Deborah needs to go to the piano
concerto for her winner concert at 1 PM. That conflicts with the Sunday
worship. Esther needs to teach Sunday school. But Lydia needs an adult at home
to be with her. It is just very difficult to work out. While everybody is
frustrating, some tears were shed. We have not noticed Lydia was on the side
quietly listened all of the conversation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Then Lydia cried out,
&quot;It’s all my fault. It’s because of me that you can not do what you would
like to do.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Yes, sometimes, things got
a bit difficult.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>In the evening, big Lydia
Wu, pastor Wu’s daughter came to visit Lydia from Chicago. She said she had a
friend from Michigan called her and thought she had brain surgery. She
explained to her friend it’s not her. But from this, we know that the prayer
chain has gone to Michigan…..<o:p></o:p></span></p>
