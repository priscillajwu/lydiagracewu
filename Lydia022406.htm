<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Dear brothers and sisters, </P>

<P>Friday nights are always so enjoyable to us.  For many years, every Friday night, my entire family would go to church attending bible study group, and children having AWANA program. Fellowship with brothers and sisters, sharing, and praying together were always with so much pleasure. </P>

<P>Recent three Friday nights were a bit different for me and Lydia. I was able to be with Lydia alone while other family members gone to church. </P>

<P>Three Fridays ago, Feb. 10, the day after Lydia's surgery, she was under a lot of pain and suffering. Under heavy dose of morphine for pain relief, one of the side effects is the difficulty to urinate. She tried very hard to urinate, but she couldn’t.  Every single move of her body would cause her a lot of discomfort and pain.  </P>

<P>She tried many ways, struggled walking to bathroom, used bed pan on her bed, tried portable toilet next to her bed..., still not able to urinate.  The nurse could insert the bladder tube back in (it was removed that Friday afternoon to prevent infection).  But Lydia did not want it, she wanted to urinate by herself.  We hoped she could fall asleep.  But she couldn't.  She needed to urinate so bad, how could she fall asleep?</P>

<P>The problem was, she did not have enough physical capability to urinate. So, back and forth, and kept trying, and a lot of moans and tears, that entire Friday night.  Hours later, really, no exaggeration, she spent over four hours, all she did is trying to urinate. </P>

<P>Finally, she did it, we heard the water dripping into the portable toilet, that was very late Friday night, at that moment, we were over-joyed with relief and tears. Never in my life realized even urination could be such a challenge.  We should thank God if we can urinate easily.  To some, it was not an easy task.</P>

<P>Recently two Friday nights including tonight, again I was able to spend the entire night with Lydia alone, and at home.  We talked, watched TV (although I fell asleep twice sitting next to her), and play cards.  I did not want leave her.  It was very enjoyable.  I would hold her hand, or touched her head and prayed.  She would show her smile with satisfaction and leaned to me.</P>

<P>I thank God for these previous Friday night moments.  Just want to share with you.</P>

<P>In Him,</P>
<P>Simon</P>
