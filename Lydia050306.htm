<P>Lydia’s school musical play dress rehearsed was held tonight.</P>
<P>She enrolled in the school musical play right before she got ill three months ago. Back then, who would have dreamed that three months later, she would be able to make it to practice and perform. Recall that before her first brain surgery, we were even worried that she might not be able to walk or speak normally again. And now, she is in the musical play singing and dancing… Our God is amazing, beyond our imagination.</P>
<P>Lydia’s school teacher, a lovely sister and a singer in Christ, recorded a CD for her. A CD with many great Christian hymns. Among the hymns, the "Amazing Grace" (she sang specially for Lydia, since Lydia’s middle name is Grace) really got me. While listening, I have to wipe my eyes several times with great emotion and thanks to the Lord. Lydia is, indeed, has been the amazing grace from the Lord.</P>
<P>Please continue praying for Lydia for her blood count to rise. She looked pale on the stage while performing. (While mom and our other daughters enjoyed the play and watching Lydia performing, tell the truth, I was a little bit stressed and concerned.) May God continue protect her from infection. God has been doing so, and I have faith Lydia will be OK.</P>
<P>Thank you for your faithful prayers. Our God listens to our prayers.</P>
<P>May God’s love and grace be with you.</P></FONT></BODY>
