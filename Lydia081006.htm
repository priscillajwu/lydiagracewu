<div class=Section1>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>August 10, 2006, Thursday<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Today, Lydia starts to have
difficulty to urinate. It would take 20 to 30 minutes just to urinate. She
would pray, press her bladder, and struggle, simply trying to pee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Once, after she finally got
urine out, I told her, good job. She said, &quot;What’s good job about it, I do
this everyday.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>To me, it’s huge defeat if
that happens to me. But she took it lightly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Also, today, her lips got
even worse. She just could not close them; therefore, she could not speak
clearly. She could not pronounce words with B, P, M, or V, F.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>When she ate (she already
has difficulty to put food into her mouth because her hand coordination and
shaking), food would come out of her mouth. She could not control it. Watching
her eating is one of the most difficult things in the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>She found out a way. When
drinking liquid or sucking through straw, or speak, she would use another hand
to help closing her lips. It’s so sad and very difficult to look at her doing
that. However, she said,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;It’s OK. I’ll try to
improve it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Her memory also got very
bad. She tried to use walker today for the first time in her life. She worked
very hard to walk to the vending machine and bought a bag of candy. It was a
huge thing this afternoon. She forgot about it totally at night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Around 5 PM today, all of
sudden, she became talkative (that is Lydia, she must be feeling better), which
have not happened for a while.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Quotes from Lydia today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Mom, why do you cry?
I will get better.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;It’s all God’s
will.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Why you look so sad,
mom, it’s OK...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Although mom and dad
is with me all the time, but often, I am with myself during test, scan or MRIs.
But I know God is with me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;I know God loves me.
God will help me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>“I need to get used to
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I need to stay strong.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Another one I could not
share, it’s too emotional and too difficult to write it down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>I have been receiving some
emails about miraculous healing. Thank God for He always gives me hope through
brothers and sisters and friends.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Two of Lydia’s doctors said
today in separate occasions,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Lydia, you have never
stopped amazing me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
