</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Yesterday, around noon, (Lydia needs weekly blood count), Lydia’s blood count sharply dropped to her record low level. We didn’t know why was that, she has been recovering from radiation for weeks by now, and her blood count has been OK, not particularly high, but not in the very low level. Now, she is very dangerously low. The doctor called and mentioned if her blood count does not go up to reasonable level before June 12 (her scheduled first chemo treatment), her chemo therapy would have to postpone again.</P>
<P>We were very puzzled during the day yesterday. Why her blood count suddenly dropped. Is she fighting something? Virus or bacteria?</P>
<P>Last night, Lydia developed fever, it’s not a good time to have fever when her blood count was so low. We prayed very hard and hope her temperature would go down like before. But this time temperature continued going up. We had to take her to the emergency room. She was admitted right away, and injected with high dose antibiotics. Her blood was drawn again to check if there was any sign of infections.</P>
<P>We kept praying in the emergency room, and the Lord gave us peace. Her temperature came down a little bit.</P>
<P>A few hours past in the ER, her new blood work came back, the blood count was much higher, just like a week ago, no longer in the dangerous low level. So, we were able to discharge from the hospital and went home this morning around 3 AM.</P>
<P>We were very puzzled why in only about 10 hours, the blood count would have changed so dramatically. My first reaction was that one of two bleed tests yesterday has to be in error. Of course, the hospital could not agree with that. They had to think both were correct. But nobody could give the good answer why blood count would have increased so much in just 10 hours, the level of increase which took Lydia several weeks to get. And today, it only took ten hours?</P>
<P>It was one of the worse nights, full of worries, prayers, and chaotic situations…</P>
<P>We were all exhausted today because of the long night yesterday. But Lydia is home now and felt OK. I could not help but keep thinking what was going on yesterday. Nothing made sense, her blood count, her sudden recovery….?</P>
<P>While I was thinking, Mom reminded me that we might have experienced another miracle. Yes, that was it. While we were so in despair yesterday. We could only rely on God, and He took care of the rest.</P>
<P>The Lord is our shepherd, we shall not want…</P></FONT></BODY>
