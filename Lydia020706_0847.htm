<P>At the suggestion of KC Fang, we would like to invite you to a Special Prayer Meeting tomorrow Wednesday Feb 8 at 8pm at Deerfield United Methodist Church. Let's join each other in prayers to lift up Lydia and the Wu Family, ask for God's mercy, care and deliverance, and strengthen our faith as we go through this great trial together as one body in Christ.</P>
<P>The originally scheduled Sunday School Teachers Meeting will be postponed to a later date.</P>
<P>In His Service,</P>
<P>Bobby Bao</P>
