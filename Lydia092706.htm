</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P>It’s so hard to live everyday without thinking of Lydia. Whenever I think about her, I cry.  So… it is just really hard not to cry.</P>
<P>I have thought about hundred of reasons to help me think positively. All the positive thoughts are supposed to help me to think of her without tears. </P>
<P>But, it’s impossible, I just miss her too much.</P>
<P>When is this going to end ?!</P>

<P>Actually, the song of &quot;Untitled Hymn (Come to Jesus)&quot; is also my favorite song. I said that to the entire family including Lydia I would like to use this hymn for my OWN memorial service. I remembered when I said that Lydia cried and said,</P>
<P>&quot;Mom, you took care of me so much while I am sick, if you die, I will cry really badly.&quot;</P>
<P>But, how would I ever expect that it ended up I am the one who sang this song to remember her in her memorial service. </P>

<P>I miss her talking so much.  Everyday, she would come home with a lot to talk about. Especially, she would talk non-stop after she has been on a field trip. She would tell me everything happened that day. But, not this time. I won’t be able to know what’s happening to her now. I have to wait until I see her again in heaven to catch up with her. It is just way too long to wait.</P>

<P>God, please help me to live the life which YOU has planned for me! Help me to continue Lydia’s mission on earth, although I really wish to see her and my heavenly Father as soon as possible.</P>
