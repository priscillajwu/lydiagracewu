</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Lydia still did not go to school today. But she had the longest session with school tutor. She continues making up what she has been missed. She may need to continue the lessons even into the summer.</P>
<P>Our church children summer musical audition was held tonight. We were not sure if Lydia wanted to do it. At the end, she did it. Although I did not see it, I am sure it must have gone well.</P>
<P>To be a normal kid, is the hope Lydia would like to have. A normal kid can do this or do that. But Lydia has so much limitation, and her future treatments could just bring in a lot more uncertainties. We just have to appreciate what we have, and God willing, then we can do it. (James, 4:15)</P></FONT></BODY>
