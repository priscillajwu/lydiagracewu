<div class=Section1>

<p><span style='font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Arial'>May 22, 2006, Monday<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>My dear prayer heroes,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>I know many of you have
been praying for us, especially for today’s MRI.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Knowing many are praying
for us, brought us comfort, and carried us through the day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>We had a very very rough
day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>We were told to arrive in
the Cincinnati Children Hospital by 9:30 AM. So, Mom and Lydia did. Upon
arrival, they were told there will be some delay. So, they waited, and
waited... Lydia was hungry and weak, and not feeling well. Her discomforts
(mainly headache) grew as the waiting seems to be forever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Minutes past, hours past,
nobody came to explain what’s going on. None at all. Mom tried to ask how much
longer it will be, the attitude from the hospital was really bad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>By the time Lydia got her
turn of MRI was in the afternoon. They arrived home in the late afternoon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia was not in good shape
at all after arriving home. She got fever again, and both her eyes were very
red. Her headache was so bad, almost like during her recovery from surgeries.
(It’s hard to believe she was doing quite well over the weekend. Is it too much
exposure and activities again like last week?)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>We were very scared and
worried. I had to keep praying to calm down. Several times, we were going to
call the hospital, but did not. It was such a struggle. We knew, once we
called, we need to go to emergency room, and will be more waiting and
suffering. Be frankly, we’d rather stay home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>We kept praying, Lydia’s
fever came down a little bit. Other girls need some helps and attentions from us
as well during the night. They dared not to ask for. But they did need help, it
was Monday night. It was a highly stressful night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>So, Mom took care of other
girls. I tried to get Lydia to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia was so in discomfort,
she banged her head, rubbed her head against the pillow. She had itchiness all
over her body, I have to apply different kinds of lotion to her bald head, and
her back (The sun burn from radiation still troubled her.) I kept massaging her
head and right leg (We believe there was nerve damage to her right leg during
the first brain surgery, and she has been suffering from it ever since.) She
was not feeling well at all, she has to keep scrolling around her bed. I was so
busy applying lotion, massaging, and calming her down. Look at my little
daughter in so much pain, my heart was aching, and I cried badly inside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;What is going
on?&quot; I cried out in my heart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Both Mom and I developed
pretty bad stomachaches tonight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>It is now way past
midnight. I still got anger toward the radiology department in the Children’s
Hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But, I know I shouldn’t. I
should have forgiven them by now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Maybe,
they were in trouble themselves, that was probably why things got so messed up
today for them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>I am praying very hard. I
have no reason not to believe God has continued healing Lydia. Her headache may
be from the fever, cold, viral infection, or simply weakness, and nothing to do
with the tumors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Please do not lose hope,
and please continue praying for Lydia and us. We pray that, if it’s God’s will,
and our God is merciful and graceful, the report of this MRI will be
encouraging.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>And, since many are praying
for us, the Lord must have allowed whatever happened today. I just need to be
obedient to the Lord, and learn the lessons from it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>I know our God has great
mercy and grace. Truly, the Lord is my only hope. Nothing else I can depend on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>In Him,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Simon<o:p></o:p></span></p>
