</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P>&#9;Lydia threw up again at noon. A lot of formula came out which was just fed through the tube. And she threw up the NG tube again.</P>
<P>&#9;Now, she could not eat, and we have no way of feeding her through the tube. Mom called the hospital and arranged nurse to come to re-insert the tube.</P>
<P>&#9;Then the struggle started again. Lydia felt so good without tube, she did not want the nurse to come. She said she would eat.</P>
<P>&#9;Well, she tried. After I came home from work till now (almost midnight), she drank about half can of Sprite, a few honey roasted peanuts, and a couple small bites of ice cream (about 1/3 of small spoon). That was it. When I tried to feed her the third bite of ice cream, she simply ran away from me, and went to the sink, about to throw up.</P>
<P>&#9;Being frustrated is one thing. The concern and sorrow in my heart are worse. I wonder why her reaction to chemotherapy would be such severe. She is having so many nauseous medicines going on at the same time, but still not able to suppress her nausea.</P>
<P>&#9;She is like a walking stick when she moved around in the house. Most of time, she simply lying down with her eyes closed or half open.</P>
<P>&#9;I wonder with so many vomiting in a short period of time. How much damage to her stomach would be. I only pray that God will watch her and take care of her during this recovery period and future treatment.</P>
<P>&#9;Lydia kept saying to me,</P>
<P>"I want to feel good."</P>
<P>"I want to be able to eat."</P>
<P>"I want to be normal…"</P>
<P>&#9;Poor little girl. So much suffering.</P>
<P>&#9;At night, Deborah played piano, and that particular piece of music made Lydia feel better.</P>
<P>"Thank you, Deborah." Lydia said loudly (to overcome the sound of the piano) to Deborah with extra strength out of her. Deborah heard it and smiled while continuing her piece. Moment like this was sweet. Like to share with you. And I thank the Lord for that.</P>
<P>&#9;Lydia was chosen for this. May God’s name be glorified through every step of her treatment.</P></FONT></BODY>
