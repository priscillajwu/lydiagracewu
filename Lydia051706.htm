</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Lydia’s fever and headache still continued today.  Comes and goes, temperature up and down.  We though it’s over, but came back again.</P>
<P>There was a celebration party for the entire casts of school musical play.  Although she has been missing school, but she found out about it and really wanted to go.  So, we went.  Lydia gave away bookmarks she made for the entire casts.  She spent a lot of time collecting little flowers and compressed them, and laminated them to the bookmarks one by one.  It’s quite a bit of effort, but she was really happy to make those.</P>
<P>Lydia’s fever has been going on for three days now.  Mom has been with her almost 24 hours a day.  Yes, Mom sleeps in the same bed with Lydia to be able to watch her closely.</P>
<P>We pray for God’s mercy and healing for Lydia, and for the entire family to stay healthy.  That is very critical to Lydia.</P>
