<P>We (Jean, Lydia, and I) had meeting with the neurosurgeon, two oncologists, two radiologists, and uncle Reggie. The discussion went very well. The doctors answered all the questions from us. They showed us the MRI with spectrum results which can identify the normal brain cell from the abnormal ones. The Children hospital doctors also sent the case to the national well known experts for their opinion. At the end, all agreed, another operation will be the best option for Lydia. </P>

<P>Lydia asked a few questions, one of them, the most critical one, "What are the risks if it is a good tissue?" </P>
<P>"It may impact the balance and coordination ability, but it can be improved by physical therapy over time." Neurologist answered. </P>

<P>I was so amazed with Lydia's maturity and courage to face the challenge. Can an adult face the situation without a certain level of fears, or doubts, or worries? To be honest, I do not sense much of those from Lydia. She did not understand? I think she understood quite well and enough in detail. All I can think of is that this is God's provision. I have to thank God for giving us a great trust and peace, specially in Lydia's mind. </P>

<P>Tonight, Lydia continued in supporting role, helping her sisters doing homeworks. She could have more time to watch TV. Instead, she rather spent time helping Priscilla doing the project. She certain did not use her illness as the excuse to be grouchy, being unhappy or asking for a lot of attentions. </P>

<P>One major thing we have decided. Lydia will attend the piano concerto compitition at UC CCM this Saturday, which she has enrolled before she was sick. This has been talked about by every doctors in her treatment team. I have little faith. Not quite sure how she can make it. We'll see. But praise the Lord for his amazing power. </P>

<P>Over the weekend, please pray for Lydia, and the surgical team, especially the neurosurgeon. May God watch over entire operation and His spirit be there guiding them. It's February 27, Monday, 7:30 AM. </P>

<P>Thank you very much, brothers and sisters, prayer worriers. You have spent so much effort and time praying for Lydia, you are truly our heroes. </P>

<P>In Him </P>
<P>Simon</P>
