how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me…</span></i><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The sweet tones of the
acappella ensemble echoed over the track and everyone at the Relay for Life.
All eyes were turned toward the screen as the slide show began. <o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>Friday
and Saturday this weekend was the annual Relay for Life. This year, my school
happened to host the event. After my amazing experience last year, I got more
involved with Relay this year. I took charge of the Luminaria committee.
Luminaria, Lydia’s favorite part of Relay last year. Seeing her name written on
41 paper bags, honoring her in her struggle, brought her so much joy. At least
she got to see it with her own eyes once. There was nothing I wanted to do more
than to make this ceremony the best it could be. For her. And even if she
wasn’t there in body, I knew she would be there in spirit. I wanted her to look
down from heaven and see even more bags than last year, remembering her. On the
way, I met with the usual challenges that come with responsibility, I struggled
and stressed, and reminded myself why I was doing this. But it wasn’t until
Friday night that the enormity of the task manifested itself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>All
night we decorated bags and filled them with sand and a candle. At 9:00 p.m. we
began rushing around setting up for the ceremony. I was pulled in every
direction, with different people constantly asking me where they were to go,
what they were to do. Dashing and sprinting from place to place, I was drenched
in sweat, dehydrated, and faint. At last 10:00 came. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>Stadium
lights off, candles lit, the slideshow began. At first only my friends gathered
around the screen, but minutes later, every person at the event and even more
outside visitors, church friends, Lydia’s school teachers, crowded on the track
to see the power point. I was astonished. Everyone sat and settled in. I
watched my little sister once again grow up on the screen. Cute little baby,
adorable toddler, talented youngster. Tears ran down my cheeks as I remembered
the beautiful girl’s wonderful life. Then, came the dreaded pictures. Sickness,
treatment, and pain. Sobs wracked my body as I cried desperately in hysteria.
Sorrow tore my heart apart. She suffered so much that she didn’t deserve.
Without my friends to hold me up, I would have collapsed, hurt pummeling me.
Finally, the pictures rolled to an end. Everyone began getting up to walk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>But to my
great surprise, my family and me were not the only ones bawling. As I looked
into <a href="100_0528.JPG">the crowd</a>, many had tears falling their eyes.
Many who I did not even know, and who had never met Lydia. Hugs abounded as
everyone supported each other. My friend later said that there wasn’t a person
around him that was not touched by the pictures and presentation. Person after
person came up to my family and I, eyes damp from tears, and whispered how
amazing Lydia was, and how inspiring the presentation of her life had been.
Several of them being people who never knew her. As I looked around I saw
groups of people praying together, crying together, and supporting each other.
Lydia’s story had touched the hearts of all. One friend told me that he felt so
bad after watching the slide show, and just wanted to be better, do better. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>She
was remembered by all, loved by all, and mourned by all. And she inspired those
who still fight against cancer, those who face struggles in their life, and
those who can not see the miracles that life holds. And she taught each and
every person there a lesson of love, faith, and hope. She illuminated the way
to our Father, opening doors for others to plant seeds. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>And though she was not there physically, her spirit
surrounded all, challenging everyone to become a better person, to further
God’s kingdom, and to Live it All. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
