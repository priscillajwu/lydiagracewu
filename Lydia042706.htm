<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>My dear prayer heroes,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia had several doctor
appointments today, the day after all the radiation treatments finished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Although Lydia has been
having more headaches, and vomits this past week than a week ago, the doctors
believed it’s the side effects of the radiation. She should feel better over
time in next couple weeks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia’s blood count has
again reached record low. Please pray for her. Lydia has a school musical play
coming up (she really wanted to do it), and that involves with rehearsing with
some schoolmates. May God give her strength, and protect her from any possible infections.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia again prepared a gift
bag for a sick child in Children’s hospital. Today, her gift bag of love was
given to a six year old girl with leukemia. So far, she has given her gift bags
of love and prayers to three children with serious illness, and she continued
praying for them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Yesterday, Lydia received a
gift from an aunt, a Crochet kit. Since then, she has been really into it, She
is making a hat for herself. It’s almost finished. She is really excited to
wear the hat which she made by herself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Our Lord really gave us
many good things everyday. We want to thank God and cheer for it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>In Him,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
