</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Lydia visited school today (She was very happy to meet the teachers and friends.), to take spring class picture. She was the only one wearing hat…</P>
<P>MRI was done this afternoon. It took the images for entire brain and spinal cord. Lydia got really itchy and sweaty after a while. It’s hard for her to stay still for hours. Many re-takes made today’s MRI very long. By the time it finished, it was already late afternoon.</P>
<P>Jean has tried to contact nurses and doctors. No doctor returned the phone call yet. I guess the doctors might not get to see the results until tomorrow.</P>
<P>Well, everything is in God’s hand. I should not worry too much (I was in great stress yesterday for whatever reason). Thank you very much for the prayers. Our God is faithful. We have hope in Him.</P>
<P>We have received words of encouragement and comfort from brothers and sisters. It helps a lot.</P>
<P>Thank God for the love of brothers and sisters in the body of Christ.</P></FONT></BODY>
