</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>There was a good deal to print photos at Kroger, so I collected them and sent it to Kroger for printing yesterday. The pictures were mainly from last December vacation we went to Disney world.</P>
<P>This afternoon, we took Lydia and Priscilla, and walked to Kroger to pick up pictures and bought some groceries. It was a longer walk, and she had some headache and felt nauseous in the store. But, it was still fun for Lydia and Priscilla. </P>
<P>After coming home, Mom looked at those pictures. She just broke into tears (of course, without Lydia being present). Looking at happy family vacation pictures at Disney world late December, how would anyone have thought, only more than a month later, things would have changed so much…  It took some effort for her to be able to continue viewing those pictures.</P>
<P>Philippians 3:13 came to our mind. Well, there is no use to feel sad about the good old happy times. We just need to face forward and seek our God, our Lord, our Savior.</P></FONT></BODY>
