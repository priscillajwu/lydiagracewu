font-family:Arial'>Dear Simon:<br>
<br>
I have meant to write to you after I read your journal on March 21, but was put
aside by the busyness of life.&nbsp; Although I have been thinking of you and
keep you in my prayers.&nbsp; I am worried about you, Simon.&nbsp; You <b><u>did
not</u></b> fail to protect&nbsp; your daughter, Simon, you did not fail
to&nbsp; keep her safe while she was here.&nbsp; You have raised her for 10
years.&nbsp; God has chose you to be this very very special father of God's
angel for 10 years.&nbsp; Your mission has accomplished.&nbsp; She was chosen
to be God's angel from the very beginning.&nbsp; Do you think Mary fail to
protect Jesus when He was crucified?&nbsp; Do you think Mary fail to keep Jesus
safe from all those heartbreaking trials?&nbsp;&nbsp; No, she didn't.&nbsp; She
was chosen to full fill God's plan, and she accepted and obeyed.&nbsp; I know,
sometimes, God's plan is too hard to understand, too heartbroken to accept,
but, who are we to judge His plan? &nbsp; <br>
<br>
&quot;Peace doesn't mean the absence of trouble, it means the presence of
God.&quot;<br>
<br>
Take it easy, Simon.&nbsp; Don't be so harsh on yourself.&nbsp; <br>
Trust in Him,</span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>
