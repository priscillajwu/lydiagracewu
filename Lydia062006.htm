</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>We went back to hospital for blood test today. Lydia’s blood count, as expected from chemo therapy, dropped to a very low level, again lowest ever. According to the doctor, she could drop to ZERO. The doctors expected her blood count continue to drop, and we need to be back to hospital this Thursday for blood transfusion.</P>
<P>Then, it’s time to talk about her eating and nutrition deficiency. We were troubled that NG tube kept thrown up by her vomiting. Should we put it back in? </P>
<P>Lydia cried and said with a lot of tears that she did not want the feeding tube. She would rather the option of nutrition directly put into her IV, although it’s very troublesome and require hospital stay initially.</P>
<P>Finally, the doctor agreed to let us think about it and decide what to do tomorrow. He let us go home without re-inserting the NG tube.</P>
<P>By the time Lydia got home, all her sisters already left for swimming meet. I also rushed to the swimming pool to participate.  Lydia stayed home with Mom, while sisters having a lot of fun swimming.</P>
<P>At night, Lydia tried to eat. But she couldn’t.</P>
<P>"I am such a failure." Lydia said sadly, "The food looks good, I like to eat, but I can’t."</P>
<P>"Maybe I have to accept that I need the NG tube." Lydia continued.</P>
<P>I am not sure what is going to happen in next two days. Will Lydia miraculously start to eat? Or she will further lose some weight, and then on Thursday, we will re-insert the tube?</P>
<P>I think we just need to cast everything in God’s hand</P></FONT></BODY>
