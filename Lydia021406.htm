<B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,<BR>
<BR>
We have talked to Children hospital oncologists tonight. Elder Tsang was<BR>
also there with us. The meeting last almost two hours. During those time,<BR>
Lydia was in her room accompanied by her four teachers from Symmes<BR>
Elementary and Blue Ash Elementary. Sister Mary was also there with Lydia.<BR>
<BR>
It was pretty strong support that God has provided to us at that time.<BR>
However, (although without much surprise) when we heard that Lydia will need<BR>
radiation therapy (6 weeks, 30 times) and chemo therapy to follows, it's<BR>
still very difficult to accept.<BR>
<BR>
Lydia was quite upset about the future treatments will be such a long<BR>
process. She said she thought she will be able to get back to normal pretty<BR>
soon, back to school, back to Awana, Sunday school, Chinese school.....<BR>
<BR>
She cried. Although quickly calmed down by Mom and Dad, I can see it was<BR>
difficult for her to accept. She is the one who has to endure it by<BR>
herself. Nobody else can suffer for her.<BR>
<BR>
She is brave. Quite brave.<BR>
<BR>
I recall the day Lydia was admitted into hospital after CT and MRI. I<BR>
brought her three sisters to visit her that night. Understanding that Lydia<BR>
has to stay behind not able to go home and seeing Lydia with all the tubes<BR>
and wires on her, sisters held one another and cried badly. It was very<BR>
difficult to watch (Jean and I both broke down). Lydia said with tears,<BR>
(like it was her fault that entire family cried so bad and trying to calm us<BR>
down) "I will get well soon, OK..." Sisters nodded. They seemed comforted<BR>
by Lydia's determination....<BR>
<BR>
Although we have tears, but God has mercy. God's grace is abundant.<BR>
Remember the peace God gave me during Lydia's surgery. It was amazing.<BR>
Now, God continue guiding us. God gave us His promise. We have faith in<BR>
it. Today, the oncologists are pretty confident that Lydia will be CURED<BR>
after these treatments.<BR>
<BR>
Please continue praying for us. With the strength from our God, the love of<BR>
the body of Christ, the support from the brothers and sisters, we are ready<BR>
for the next.<BR>
<BR>
In Him<BR>
Simon and family<BR>
