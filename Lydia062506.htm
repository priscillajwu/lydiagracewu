</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P>Dear Prayer partners,</P>

<P>This weekend, everyone in our family was very busy attending church events, but Lydia and me. Once, Lydia mentioned before that home without her sisters is no fun at all. I tried to make her feel good and eat more these two days without everyone was around. </P>

<P>Saturday morning, Lydia has blood work done. Originally, Doctors already planned to give her red blood cell transfusion on Thursday. (We ended up only giving her platelet transfusion and N-J feeding tube because Lydia had some reaction from the platelet transfusion.) If Saturday labs came back was low, we needed to go back to hospital for more blood. But, thank God, Lydia’s Hemoglobin was high enough to avoid blood transfusion this time.</P>
<P>I was very happy to hear from the nurse who gave me a quick run data. It seemed not a big deal to Lydia.</P>
<P>&quot;Why you are so worried about blood transfusion? If I need it, I need it.&quot; Lydia said lightly.</P>
<P>It seemed she took a lot of stuff so well. This made me heartache.</P>

<P>These days, the feeding tube is bothering her nose and throat. Eating will irritate her throat more. Her right thigh has strange feeling and sometimes is painful. Everyday I need to give her a shot to help raise her blood counts called G-CSF. That shot made her bones hurt. … … All these discomfort load upon our little Lydia. </P>
<P>My parents came a week ago from Taiwan to help out. They truly experienced our bravery girl. How tough she is! How our God made her so strong. Thank you, Lord!</P>
<P>Thanks for your love, and please continue praying for her blood count, weight gaining and total recovery.</P>
