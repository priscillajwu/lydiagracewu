<p><span style='font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Arial'>May 7, 2006, Sunday<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia has performed all
three shows of school musical play over the weekend. </span><a
href="100_8484.JPG"><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>The play</span></a><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'> was so great. All the children,
parents, relatives, and friends enjoyed the shows so much. As to us, while
enjoy watching Lydia and many other children performing, not only so
entertaining, we were extremely thankful to our God, for He performed the
miracle in this play.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>(Tell the truth, at first,
the play staffs were thinking that maybe Lydia could just show up for a few
seconds in one of the three shows. That would be great, and we were not even
sure if that could happen.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>The entire cast started
practicing the same week Lydia was diagnosed with brain tumor. For the past
three months, the school play and </span><a href="100_6811.JPG"><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia’s fight</span></a><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'> with disease seem going in parallel
(means they would not cross each other). As the school play getting in shape
over time, Lydia has gone through so much, two brain surgeries, one spinal tap
and port insertion surgery, scary CT and MRI results one after another one,
hospital stays, radiation therapies, too many medicines, aches, pains, extreme
discomforts, countless hospital visits…. Who would have thought (including
ourselves, we did not think it’s possible and did not dare to dream about it)
that Lydia would be back to the play and with her friends performed together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>At the end, the two lines
intersected. </span><a href="100_8413.JPG"><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Arial'>Lydia joined the play</span></a><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Arial'>. God’s way is really higher than ours.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>An aunt came to watch the
play. Whenever Lydia showed up on the stage, she could not help but crying. She
knew what Lydia has been through. What appeared in front of her was a miracle,
a live miracle…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia received so much love
and support from the school, entire play casts, staffs, families, and many
others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>God’s love came in many
wonderful forms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Our God has mercy and great
healing power. Our God is amazing. If you were with us during this journey,
please join us to praise the Lord.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Oh, Lord, thank you….<o:p></o:p></span></p>
