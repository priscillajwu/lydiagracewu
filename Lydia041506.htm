<P>Our Dear Prayer Partners,</P>

<P>Yesterday was Good Friday, Daddy took a day off and brought whole family to the Zoo by Lydia’s request.  Lydia was very excited and was looking forward to it. Our radiation nurse reminded us to stay outdoors and stay away from people. She got to put on a cap, hooded clothes, a mask, and a lot of sunscreen lotion to protect her. </P>
<P>I asked Lydia &quot;What’s your favorite part at zoo?&quot;</P>
<P>She answered, &quot;Not any certain part, it’s just good to be out. To feel fresh.&quot;</P>
<P>We were worried about she might be too tired. Actually, she was very tired and even felt her heart was aching after we came home. But we praise the Lord for giving her strength to enjoy the beautiful day in the zoo. We also prayed about she would be all right and she will gain more strength to do what she used like to do.</P>

<P>These days she is feeling more nauseous, she even threw up on Friday night. Please pray for her condition and appetite (she doesn’t like to eat).</P>

<P>I was trying to tell a friend how God loves Lydia by granting her wishes. This is one of them…</P>
<P>Lydia is a very neat girl who likes to feel clean. She hasn’t been able to take a shower since she got admitted to hospital ICU on February 6. She really wanted to take a shower and wash her hair. All we could do was using wash cloth to bath her on the bed. There wasn’t a shower in the room. The night before her first surgery, a nurse came in and asked us to move to another room located in another area. First, I refused to move. </P>
<P>I asked, &quot;Why us? Why the night right before she is having surgery?&quot;</P>
<P>The poor nurse came back, &quot;There is a staffing problem, and it is a bigger room.&quot;</P>

<P>As soon as we got in the room, I knew why we had to move. God provided a big private room with a shower for Lydia to take a nice shower before surgery. Although we took some time to bandage her IV to prevent getting wet, Lydia did feel much better after that shower. I cried and praised the Lord for His provision. I know God loves us very much!</P>

<P>Thanks for praying for us!</P>

<P>Love,</P>
<P>Jean</P></FONT></BODY>
