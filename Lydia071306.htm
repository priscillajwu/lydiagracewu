</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Praise the Lord and thank you for your prayers.  Lydia continued feeling all right today.  She discharged from hospital and came home this evening.</P>
<P>So far, the second chemotherapy has been better than the first one.  Although still feeling very nauseous, she did not throw up at all so far.  We really thank God for He is faithful and full of grace and mercy.</P>
<P>Lydia even had her first acupuncture therapy today in the hospital.  Lydia asked the doctor a lot of questions.  It’s very new to Lydia.  We thank God for the option of the acupuncture treatment.  </P>
<P>Lydia is still not eating much.  The NJ tube feeding has been stopped since Monday (the first day of chemo).  We started to feed her through the tube tonight with a small amount.</P>
