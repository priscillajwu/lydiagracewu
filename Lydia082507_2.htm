remember Lydia Grace Wu, a 10 year old girl?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of you may know… <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>She is a celloist, only allowed to play cello if she could do
extremely well and win in her 3 competitions for piano.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She indeed won.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>She is a great pianist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>She is a swimmer!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Loves the
water rushing by her as she swam her laps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>She is a dancer, her along with the rest of the family, loving to
dance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She is a singer, with a
beautiful tender sweet voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For those of you who saw her achieve in all of these
wonderful gifts and talents, whether as fellow students, or as teachers who had
the privilege to teach such a brilliant mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>She is a good student, wanting to soak in all that she could, wanting to
do well in all that she put her hands to, put her mind to… put her heart to.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Seeing her eyes excited and filled with joys
of learning… her eyes excited about life, about living, about growing in mind,
body, heart, and spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For some of us, she is a friend.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>And to a very select few:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>She is a sister, she is a daughter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>She played with you, she listened to you, she encouraged you, she
comforted you, she laughed with you, she cried with you… and knowing the Wu
family… she probably argued with you a lot… even called you out when you did
something wrong – but with her – in the way she talked, the way she said things…
it’s okay if she corrected you… because you knew, you saw, you experienced her
deep concern for you … as she lived her life in loving you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How are we to remember Lydia Grace Wu?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are some of us who are here, who do not know her as a
student, a classmate, a friend, a sister, or a daughter.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Why are you here?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>You’ve heard her story and some of you have travelled far and
wide to be here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thank you.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You are here because you want to remember
her, not because of her death, not because of her dying, but because of her
LIFE and her living, especially through her last year as she battled and fought
against cancer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She lived it well, she
lived it all… lovingly not just to her family, not just to her friends, but
even to strangers… to the doctors, to the nurses, and to the other
patients.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Throughout the last year of
her life – she was all about loving you as best as she could.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Did she ever get grumpy?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Yeah, I’m sure she did and she probably did snap at people, especially
at those she loved most.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But soon after
– this is how beautiful and pure her love was… She would apologize and ask for
forgiveness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Sorry for being grumpy at
you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sorry for snapping at you.”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some of you probably think, “Oh Lydia, you don’t
have to apologize – cuz we understand.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>But in her heart, Lydia knew this one fact – that the pain and suffering
she was going through is NOT a good reason to stop loving others.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is NOT a good reason to think only of
herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is NOT a good reason to
leave words of bitterness to those she loves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How are we to remember Lydia Wu?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How was she able to do all of that?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To live 10 years of her life, and truly b/c
of how she LIVED her last year, battling through cancer, battling through
treatments, through the pain, through the suffering… that she could be such a
bright light in the darkness of this world, that ALL of you are here, ALL of
you are touched, ALL of you are drawn b/c of her story… HOW did she live life
so well, living it all?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How are we to remember little Lydia?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I tell you the truth - It is not JUST the name of Lydia that
we remember tonight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is not JUST the
name of the WU family that we remember tonight.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It is the name of Grace – her middle name.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The word GRACE that only exists and that we
can ONLY understand the meaning of it because of one other person – for tonight
we remember not just the name of Lydia Grace Wu, but the name of Jesus Christ…
for it is because of Jesus that Lydia could live her life the way that she did
– full of love, full of zeal, full of passion, full of purpose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Purpose?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>10
years?!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Purpose?! … </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do you know why Lydia was such a bright light of hope and of
love?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I know that if she were here and
you asked her why, she would say, “B/c I love you, and I love you, because
Jesus loves me and you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Do you know
Jesus?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Do you want to know Jesus?”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She knew Jesus as so good, the creator of
all things – the one who created her beautiful, who created her talented in so
many ways, the one who created to be so intelligent and growing in wisdom, in
maturity, and in love – that her passion was to be a missionary to go and tell
others about how good God is, and how good Jesus is – not because of all the
good things that indeed God gave to her, but b/c she knew that Jesus is the
way, the truth and the life!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To find meaning and purpose is because of Jesus.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To experience love to love others to KNOW
love fully is b/c of Jesus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To truly Enjoy
this life – overcoming the evils of this world the evils in our lives… to find
healing for the brokenness because of our sins and mistakes… is all b/c of
Jesus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The only way we have hope for
the future (hope in eternity) is b/c of Jesus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>And if she were here right now, she’d tell you it is all because of
Jesus – I lived it well, I lived it all b/c of Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the beauty of today is – she has already told you
exactly that – in the way she lived.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the cancer stripped away everything of her physical
beauty, physical strength, sapping away her talents and gifts, even her
intellect and ability to speak – these things remained clear – her hope and
love in Jesus and her love for others…. All of it because she knew Jesus had
forgiven her and helped her overcome her sins and have GIVEN her true life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For those of you who are here and you want to remember
Lydia’s story and perhaps even tell it to others, know this – in order to tell
her story well, you have to know Jesus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In order for you to speak the truth about her life, you have to know
Jesus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Do you know Jesus?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For those of you who do not know Jesus… I pray that you do…
for this world is filled with false purpose, false meaning… with pleasures that
should have been good but have been twisted and distorted and abused without
Jesus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are pursuits of
self-glory, self-gain, self-popularity, self-success/achievement… all in order
to make <u>our mark</u> in the history of mankind.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>We watch things like American Idol, So You Think You Can Dance,
America’s Got Talent, and the World Olympics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>And… Lydia could sing, Lydia could dance, Lydia had many talents, and
Lydia could swim.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And although the
winners of such events will make a mark in the history of mankind, the life of
Lydia’s 10 years will leave a mark into your lives DEEPER than ANY of those
famous people could ever leave… and your heart will ache and long for whatever
Lydia has in her life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And I tell you
the truth, Lydia has Jesus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Do you want
to know Jesus?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For those of you who know Jesus… tonight we know that indeed
it is a sorrowful night… but for those of us with a faith similar to Lydia’s we
know that tonight is a wonderful night – that no matter how many tears have
been shed, and no matter what tears we are shedding now we praise our God, our
Father in heaven.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Yes, Lydia’s story is
true and powerful, and it is only such b/c of Jesus.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>But I look at all of you that love our God as much as Lydia.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We all have a story to tell of Jesus’ love
for all of us… we also have a life to live for Jesus.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>If God can use Lydia’s life of 10 years to impact others, he can
and he will use yours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Have you
accepted Jesus as center of your life as Lydia did?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>What’s your story of Jesus in your life?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps you have fallen away from Jesus, and Lydia’s life
brings you to shame.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Good.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>BUT - Do NOT run away from Jesus!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Take that shame, take the sin that is ruining
your life and bring to God and he will heal you, he will forgive you, he will
take it away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And you too can be like
Lydia with a powerful and true story… filled with love, filled with hope, and
filled with grace… all because of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How are we to remember Lydia Grace Wu?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Listen
to the words of Lydia’s favorite hymn, Amazing Grace… and hear how her life
echoes behind the words.</p>

<p>Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,<br>
That saved a wretch like me.<br>
I once was lost but now am found,<br>
Was blind, but now I see.</p>

<p>T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear.<br>
And Grace, my fears relieved.<br>
How precious did that Grace appear<br>
The hour I first believed.</p>

<p>Through many dangers, toils and snares<br>
I have already come;<br>
'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far<br>
and Grace will lead me home.</p>

<p>The Lord has promised good to me.<br>
His word my hope secures.<br>
He will my shield and portion be,<br>
As long as life endures.</p>

<p>Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,<br>
And mortal life shall cease,<br>
I shall possess within the veil,<br>
A life of joy and peace.</p>

<p>Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,<br>
That saved a wretch like me.<br>
I once was lost but now am found,<br>
Was blind, but now I see.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thank you, Lydia Grace Wu, you are the light of the world… we
love you, we miss you</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>… and Lord Jesus Christ – we love you, we thank you, and we
praise your name – forever and ever–Amen.</p>
