</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>My dear prayer heroes,</P>
<P>Lydia had wonderful weekend. She went to school musical play practice, went out to restaurant for the very first time since she got sick in February, went to Sunday school, and did some school homework… She even tried swing across </FONT><A HREF="100_8255.JPG"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>monkey bars</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4> yesterday (during musical practice break). She did two laps, and was very tired and got very sore muscle afterwards. (Well, she used to be able to do 20 laps without feeling tired.) But we are happy that she could start to get some physical exercises. Thank the Lord.</P>
<P>Last night, she stayed up really late. She told mommy, she was so happy for the day, and did not want to sleep, because once she fell asleep, the happy day she had would end.  This made mom feel sad.  A normal day (like for regular kids), will make Lydia very happy if she could have one. Yes, a normal day seems luxury for Lydia nowadays.</P>
<P>Although Lydia had very good weekend, I was under a lot of stress and very irritable. I wondered why was that. Did somebody say something to me made me sad or angry? No. (As matter of fact, Saturday morning, I had opportunity to spend quality time with God while waiting for children’s piano lessons.  It was good.)  I prayed, and realized that, we (I and my wife) were very worried about Lydia’s condition. She has very low blood count. We were afraid that she would get infected. But, those activities did keep her spirits up. It was difficult for us to balance them. We pray that God gives us wisdom and God will protect Lydia…</P>
<P>Tonight, while Lydia took shower, she noticed she got some bruises from some activities she did over the weekend. She said she felt good about it. Those bruises made her feel normal. Thank the Lord, for Lydia looked at things very positively. (Definitely very different from a healthy person.)</P>
<P>In Him,</P>
<P>Simon</P></FONT></BODY>
