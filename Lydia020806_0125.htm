<B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Dear colleagues,</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"><P>My 9 year-old daughter, Lydia, complained about mild headache last Monday. My wife brought her to pediatrician. We were told she had strap throat, and the symptom could have mild fever.</P>
<P>Lydia took anti-biotics for couple days, and then went to school. </P>
<P>The headaches continue, she came home Thursday because of vomiting.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Friday, she still did not feel well. My wife brought her to pediatrician again Friday evening. This time urine and blood lab work were performed. No abnormality the doctor can find. She assured us over the weekend, Lydia will get better, her headache could be from the flu.</P>
<P>Over the weekend, Lydia continue having mild headache, threw up a couple times. Again, we thought that is typical flu symptom.</P>
<P>Monday, My wife was suspicious about her symptom. And called Children hospital for a CT scan. It was not easy. But thank God, we were able to get in for mid afternoon appointment.</P>
<P>I was thinking that this was only an everything-OK-type of check, we are doing CT scan just to be safe.....</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"><P>I took Lydia to Children hospital Monday afternoon around 2 PM. Her headache became pretty bad. She complained about bumpiness of the car even though it was pretty smooth on the high way.</P>
<P>She managed got out of car in Children hospital parking garage, after a few steps, she fell to the ground because of great pain caused weakness. I pick her up and walked all the way to the CT room. CT scan was quickly done. While we were waiting, a children social worker and doctor came to explain the situation, showed me the abnormality of her brain. She was admitted to the ICU right away. An MRI followed. A couple hours later, it was confirmed a brain tumor. The size of tumor is several inches. It was so big (I can not believe my eyes) and somewhat mingled with critical parts of the brain. Most likely malignant.</P>
<P>More test and MRI yesterday. She was closely monitored in ICU since Monday afternoon.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"><P>I spent past two days with Lydia, her pain grew exponentially over last two days. When the pain got so severe, she cried "Daddy, please help". I wished I can suffer for her. Last night was a rough night. A morphine dose was given to her. </P>
<P>She is quite brave and, of course, a lot of questions about what's going on. She said a lot of "sorry" (because of her needs of assistance) and "thanks" to me and my wife, and doctor and nurses. That really gave me big lump in my throat. When my other daughters, (two older, one younger), visited Lydia. The scene they hold together and cried. I could barely watched.</P>
<P>The surgery is scheduled tomorrow, Thursday, 7:30 AM. It will be a whole day operation. What Lydia will become is heavily depending on what's going on tomorrow. </P>
<P>I ask for your prayer. I'll deeply appreciate.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Thanks</FONT> <BR>
