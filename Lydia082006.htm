</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Lydia has not woken up yet today. And she is on oxygen mask all day long.</P>
<P>Earlier today, Lydia did not have enough urine. Doctors and nurses thought there was some water in her lung. (They kept assuming Lydia is failing. Maybe kidney, lung… They believed it will happen one by one. They did not believe God will heal.) Actually, no urine out is because the catheter did not work right. After changed to a new catheter and kept good maintenance flushing, Lydia’s urine amount is very good. For the lung, after two X-rays, there is nothing to worry about.</P>
<P>In the morning, Lydia had her first episode of the stop of breathing. It was so scary for all of us. Mom made many phone calls for urgent prayers.</P>
<P>The on-call doctor explained that Lydia’s organs are doing fine. It’s her brain is not function well to command her lung to breathe. He believed Lydia is in very ultimate end stage, and will not make it through today. He strongly suggested I called all the family members coming for last time. He said this would not be a false alarm.</P>
<P>I was not happy at all. I did not answer him what I would do (although yesterday we did arrange all the family members coming to visit Lydia this afternoon). He did not need to be so sure about the end of a life. The timing is in God’s hand. I knew he was out of good intent, I don’t like the way he showed that he was so sure about it.  He (not Lydia’s doctor, just on-call doctor) tried every way to prove he was right that Lydia will die very very soon.  Every new symptom gave him something to say or to remind us again.  I think probably most people would have given up by now.  That’s why doctors were acting this way.</P>
<P>Many people came to visit Lydia. There are also many people (Lydia’s teachers and parents from her school, family friends, neighbors, brothers and sisters from the church) got together in the hospital chapel having a prayer service for Lydia’s healing. Family members were also praying for Lydia very hard in her room.</P>
<P>That was in the afternoon, after the on-call doctor predicted Lydia only had hours to live. In the contrary, during the time, we had a lot of hope and our faith was encouraged through the prayers we cried out to God, our heaven father.</P>
<P>At the end of day, Lydia continued having breathing problem, she would stop or very shallow breathing. Then, back breathing again. Many times this had happened.</P>
<P>Although Lydia’s condition seems to be so bad, totally no hope in human’s eye. I think now the faith would make the difference.</P>
<P>Faith is beyond modern science advancement, is beyond doctors’ past experiences, is beyond our imagination. Our God is amazing God, and He is full of mercy and grace, and He listens to our prayers from desperation.</P>
<P>We still have the faith and hope that God will heal Lydia. Lydia will wake up…  Just like Lydia believes.</P></FONT></BODY>
