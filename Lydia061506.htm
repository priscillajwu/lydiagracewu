<P>We continued trying different combination of the anti-nauseous medicines.  Many have side effects and cause her more and different kinds of discomfort.</P>
<P>Lydia felt very nauseous many times during the day, and threw up.  However, toward the late afternoon, her condition seems to be better controlled.</P>
<P>There was a long discussion whether Lydia needs the NG tube or not.  Can she eat enough by herself?  Can she stand the discomfort of the tube with her all the time?  After a lot of prayers and observation how Lydia was doing today, finally we decided to give it a try. </P>
<P>Lydia was really scared at first.  When the nurses came, she said she knew she needed it but she just could not do it.  With prayers with Mom and nurses, and the simulation on a stuff animal, she let the nurse insert the tube.  It went smoothly.  However, looking at </FONT><A HREF="100_9379.JPG"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>her</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>, my heart ached terribly.</P>
<P>Lydia got very emotional today.  They (Mom and Lydia) cried often in the hospital…</P>
<P>However, they are holding up OK.  </P>
<P>I thank the Lord although all of these are so difficult, but the Lord is with us.  And we have hope, the true hope which stays and could not be taken away…</P>
