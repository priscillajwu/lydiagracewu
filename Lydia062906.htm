</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>With feeding tube, Lydia has no pressure about how much she has to eat. Most of her nutrition would be automatically pumped into her belly. However, not like eating from mouth, the rate of tube feeding is pretty slow. The pump needs to be on about 12-16 hours a day in order to provide just enough calories for her. That means Lydia would need to carry the pump stand whenever she goes, up or down stairs, bathroom trips during the night. She needs to be very careful when moving around, sometimes, she would call for help. Lately, Priscilla has been the great help, and she enjoys helping Lydia. When I saw </FONT><A HREF="100_9455.JPG"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>two little girls</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4> working on the pump and moving around, it’s very cute, and adorable (although always with slight sadness in my heart).</P>
<P>Many times, during the night, Lydia would wake up because the pump is not working right, or the tube got clogged, or the feeding make her stomach uncomfortable. I or Mom would need to help her fix the problem if she could not fix by herself. She told us, sometimes, she would have hard time to fall back to sleep for a long time... </P>
<P>Although with all these troubles, she is still thankful we have the feeding pump, which at least keep up her weight, and she did not need to eat much.</P>
<P>Eating has become very challenging for her. She could not stand the smell of strong flavor food. Unfortunately, spicier food usually came with stronger smell. Plain food does not give her good appetite. They seem to contradict each other.</P>
<P>Kitchen is the least place Lydia would like to stay. When there is cooking going on, often, she has to escape to upstairs.</P>
<P>Nowadays, I appreciate that I can eat, and I thank God very much for that. Some, like Lydia, not able to eat at will would certainly very envy us who can eat.</P></FONT></BODY>
