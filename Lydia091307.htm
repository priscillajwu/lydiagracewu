</span>By Esther Wu<span style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><span

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>“Becca! Come on! We’re gonna be late
for swim practice!” I grabbed my swim bag and dashed out the front door. Hannah
was getting into her brand new car as I stumbled off the front porch. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>“Sheesh,
I’m coming. Coach Dave doesn’t care that much if we’re late anyway!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>“Just get in the car! Our perfect
attendance record will be ruined if we’re late. And I want to have it my senior
year.” I sighed as I climbed into the front seat of my sister’s car. I really
didn’t like Hannah reminding me that she was graduating this year. In all
honesty, life without Hannah was simply unthinkable. Being only a year apart,
the two of us did everything together and had pretty much all the same
interests. Especially swimming. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>The normal smile that graces my
complexion appeared as I thought of the activity that characterizes our
life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Hannah and I had been raised in
the water. At the age of three, our parents had pretty much thrown us in the
ocean and said “Sink or swim.” Living in various cities along the coast of
Florida our entire life, beaches and oceans were regular neighbors. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>Swim practice was always the norm at
the house. Both of us swam on the school swim team, the Manta Rays, and we’ve
won three state championships in a row. Despite the hard work of having two
practices for hours every day, I always felt so naked without my goggles, swim
cap, and suit. As I slipped into the pool for yet another exhausting afternoon
practice, I wouldn’t have been happier anywhere else. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>“Whew! That was a ton of fun.
Heh, I guess Dave wants that title again this year.” Hannah smiled her
mischievous grin as she wrung the chlorinated water out of her hair. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>“Yeah.
Those 800 IMs were pretty annoying. Hey, why don’t we stop by the beach on the
way home?” Hannah’s eyes lit up at the suggestion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>“Definitely.
We haven’t been by there for a couple days.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The ocean looked so
beautiful and absolutely irresistible in the late afternoon sun. Hannah and I
sprinted toward the waves, whooping at the top of our lungs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>“Ahh, this is the life.”
Hannah floated contentedly in the water. The beach was barely visible now, just
a tiny speck in the distance. The waves tossed us around gently, carrying us
farther and farther from shore. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:BatangChe'>Suddenly,
the waves started to pull back from us. Alarmed, I gazed towards the open
ocean, and perceived a gigantic wave beginning to sweep toward us. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>“Hannah! We gotta to get out
of here! Look!” Hannah’s horrified face showed me that she saw the wave as
well. We began to uselessly try to get to shore. </span><span style='font-size:
16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:BatangChe'>Seconds
later, I felt the wave pick me up and thrust me into its waiting expanse. Water
seeped into my nose and pounded me on every side. However, to my surprise, the
wave let me go. Gasping for air, I pushed to the surface of the water. </span><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Knowing full well that I was
lucky to be alive, I quickly looked around trying to locate my older sister.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:BatangChe'>“Hannah!
Hannah, where are you?!?” There was no response. “Hannah!” I could feel my
heart sinking as I continued to call for my sister. </span><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Frantically, I turned in circles
screaming for Hannah. </span><span style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:BatangChe'>When I got no answer, I briskly swam
to shore, calling desperately for help. The peace of the beach was shattered as
yells and screams spread across it. Screeching sirens soon joined the fog of
chaos that swirled around me. I sank to my knees upon the beach as the search
crews rushed out. Despair and hopelessness swept over me in yet another wave.
My brain could no longer function, and I sat woodenly upon the beach. Now </span><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>all I could hear was the
steady swishing as the ocean hit the sand beneath my feet. </span><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:BatangChe'>Then,
the search parties came back…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>And my world came to a
screeching halt.</span><span style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
mso-fareast-font-family:BatangChe'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:BatangChe'>No
tears would come. A robotic numbness took hold and steered me, unfeeling,
through the next few days. A</span><span style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt'>ll I could do was stare blankly ahead. Not speaking, not hearing, and
not seeing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Life continued to go on, and
in trying to keep up, I became an expert at putting on a mask each day at
school. All my friends saw the strong, spirited, and occasionally stubborn teen
that had always been there before. Few could see through the mask, and fewer
still wanted to do anything about it. No one knew the numbness had faded away,
and that I now cried myself to sleep every night. My parents didn’t even know.
They had enough pain to be getting on with themselves. Worst of all, I had
nothing to take my mind off Hannah. Not even swimming. My <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>one
love in life no longer had any appeal. In fact I hated it. It was this love of
the water and swimming that had taken Hannah away. My sister, and my best
friend. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:BatangChe'>On
one of many lonely nights, I crawled into Hannah’s old bed. As I picked up her
old physics book, a piece of paper fluttered out. Picking it up, I began to
read. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt'>I’m really, really bored right now. My physics teacher is just droning
on and on. So I decided to write you a letter. I hope life is going great for
you. Yeah, junior year is really hard, but hang tight, you’re a smart and
stubborn girl (Occasionally too stubborn :-P) you’ll be alright. Yeah, I know I
rat on you all the time about one thing or another, but you know I’m joking.
You’re an amazing gal, and one I’ m proud to call my beloved little sis. I know
it’ll be really weird not having me around the house and stuff after I
graduate, but you’ll only have one more year at home. We’ve had a ton of good
times and memories, and I want you to keep making them yourself. Keep swimming
and doing all the things we love. And I’ll come visit, don’t worry. We’ll catch
up on everything. And always remember I love you very much, and to live life to
the absolute fullest.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

my heap of swimming stuff collecting dust in the corner. </span><span
