<p><span style='font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Arial'>September 1, 2006, Friday<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>For last several days, the
flowers in Lydia’s grave would be gone the day after we put it. We did not know
what happened. Today, we were pretty sure that the flowers were eaten by the
wild animals, probably deers. I was quite upset in the first place. Later, I
thought, well, that is OK (Lydia’s always said that for things we do not have
the control over). Maybe we’ll just have to use the artificial flowers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>It’s Friday again. It’s the
first Friday night Lydia was not around. (Last Friday, many people came to
visit, I was standing next to Lydia’s casket.) I recalled many good memories
about Friday nights. I was home with Lydia alone. We would do many things
together. Tonight, I wept several times pretty badly. Grandma (dad’s mom) told
me not to think about her. I am not sure if she knows what she is talking
about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>I and Lydia played a lot of
games on those Friday nights. She was very good and graceful. Whenever she
lost, she would say she was not good at it yet (never too upset about it). She
would like to try it again. Only a few games more, she would be able to beat
me. Then, she would said,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Did you do that on
purpose to let me win to make me happy?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;No, not at all, I am
playing it seriously.&quot; I said pretty surely, &quot;You just learn things
very fast.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Yes, she gave her best in
everything she did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Recall back in August 10,
Lydia used a walker to walk from her room to the vending machine in the
hospital. That was the last time in her life to walk by herself. Walking along
the hall way, with mom and dad, doctor and nurses around, with her arms and
legs shaking along each step, she kept saying,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Yes, I need to stay
strong.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;I need to get
better.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;God will help
me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;I will get
better.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;I can do it, I can do
it …&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Back then, I cheered for
her. The doctor and nurses’ eyes were watery. Now, only thought about it would
get me totally torn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Many people said Lydia is
truly inspirational. But I wish she would have complained more, or whined more,
or did not try that hard to fight the disease. That would make me less in
sorrow, or less guilty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Of course I am proud of her.
But recalling her pure hope and faith while she was terribly suffering, just
made me cry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>And why she was that
strong. Well, it must be from God, and because of the prayers of many…<o:p></o:p></span></p>
