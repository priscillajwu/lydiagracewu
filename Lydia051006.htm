<div class=Section1>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>May 10, 2006, Wednesday<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Five years ago, Esther won
the school spelling bee competition when she was in fourth grade. Two years
ago, Deborah won the same spelling bee competition when she was a fourth
grader.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Now, as a fourth grader,
Lydia did not want to be part of it at all. We knew it’s a lot pressure on her
and she has been through a lot lately. But Deborah strongly encouraged Lydia at
least to try. Even that gave Lydia a lot of stress and she cried badly. She
just did not want to do it. I agreed that she does not need to compete if she
does not want to. To me, as long as she could survive from the cancer and the
harsh treatments, to be a good speller or not, is the least of my concerns.
However, with encouragement from her teacher and classmates, she participated
in the class qualifier run, and she was one of the four qualifying students
chosen to represent her class.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>To my surprise, and also
everybody else’s surprise, she not only participated, but also won the school
spelling bee competition today. I can only give the glory to our God, because
God has mercy and grace on her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>We were told that the
radiation treatment to the brain might have permanent damage to the patients,
which could show up later. She may have learning difficulties and many other
possible problems for years to come. We can only pray that God’s grace and
mercy will continue to be with her…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>We asked her why she won,
while she really had a very slim chance to win (being so ill and out of school
for several months.) What lesson does God want us to learn?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;For the sick, do not
lose hope.&quot; Lydia said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Tomorrow, she will have
another blood test. Please pray for her blood count and appetite.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
