<div class=Section1>

<p><span style='font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Arial'>August 2, 2006, Wednesday<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia got up this morning,
as usual, with terrible headache and nausea. After feeding her many pain and
anti-nauseous medicines, she kind of felt better, and went ahead to play with
her siblings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Only couple hours later,
her headache grew so severe that she could only cry and scream (it’s really
worse than ever). Mom tried to calm her down. Lydia said she could not stand
anymore and about to call 911 by herself to get the ambulance to get her to the
hospital. Very concerned, mom called the hospital, and was told to rush to the
hospital. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>In the hospital, a brain CT
scan, and X-ray on her belly were quickly performed. During those hours, again,
difficult and hard to endure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
experience of February 6<sup>th</sup> came to my mind again. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Actually, I would not think it’s another
tumor (mom afraid so). We have been doing high dose radiation therapy and
chemotherapy. But why, why is she still having so much headaches.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Hours later, CT scan and
X-ray results came back normal. Which is good. Thank God. But then, what, what
is causing her headache.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>By the time I came home
late in the night, mom and Lydia were still in the hospital, closely monitored.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia will have several
doctors scheduled to see her tomorrow. We pray for God’s healing, pray for the
doctors able to find the cause of her headache and be able to treat her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>One more thing, we were
planning to attend baseball game tonight, a free invitation, courtesy of
Cincinnati Reds for the entire family (for brain cancer patient family).
Everybody was so excited since several days ago. However, we had to give it up
since Lydia is in the hospital under the emergency care.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>A day like today is very
difficult to live. We can only come before the Lord and ask for his mercy…<o:p></o:p></span></p>
