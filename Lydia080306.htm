</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Quite a few doctors came to check Lydia today.  </P>
<P>The conclusion was that acupuncture is not really helpful, only cause her more stress.  The pain medicines are not really working either.</P>
<P>At the end, the doctors suggested Lydia to take medicine which helps bring up brain chemicals.  It’s some kind of anti-depressant medicine.  And we don’t know if it will work for sure or not.</P>
<P>Well, I suggested as long as there is no urgent physical problem we need to treat, if it’s only caused by stress or brain chemicals.  Then, we may be able to help her through other ways, like talks, massaging, and distractions (i.e. make her happy and bring up her spirits).  For this, we need a lot of your prayers.  It would be best if Lydia can improve without the medicines.  The doctors agreed.</P>
<P>However, Lydia’s headache continues to get worse today.  She threw up so many times today, according to mom, the most ever.</P>
<P>It’s now very late in the night.  I stay in hospital with Lydia through the night.  Mom has gone home to take care other girls.  On her bed side, looking at her, I pray that Lydia’s condition can improve tomorrow, so that we can go home to celebrate her 10<SUP>th</SUP> birthday.  Also, she was recommended to attend the Ohio State Fair spelling bee competition this Saturday in Columbus (she was spelling bee winner of her school).  Lydia wanted to go very much, since both Esther and Deborah went years ago and did well in the competition.</P>
<P>I don’t know if she can go or not (it’s very unlikely, based on her condition now.)  We don’t know how things will be this weekend.  We cast everything in God’s hand.  </P>
<P>No matter what’s coming, may God’s name be glorified.</P>
