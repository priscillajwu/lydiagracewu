<P>Dear Prayer Partners,</P>

<P>&quot;All she ate was an orange Popsicle.&quot; A few hours later she threw up, again…</P>

<P>I still remember the first time she came out of surgery, when she was in ICU, with swollen eyes from a scratch in her cornea. After the 12 hours surgery, her mouth was swollen, and her tongue lolled out of her mouth with every word. Still, when asked if she wanted a Popsicle, she eagerly consented. Although each lick was difficult, and she threw up soon afterwards, it was such a beautiful sight to watch her enjoying her Popsicle. At least she was happy and content for a little bit. </P>

<P>Today, Lydia doesn’t want to eat anything. She has no appetite. She didn’t want a Popsicle, but she tried to eat it anyway. And again, she threw up. The chemotherapy has taken a terrible toll on her body. A continued nausea, yet she can’t afford to throw up, she needs to eat. Lydia has lost too much weight; she’s too light. The doctors are thinking that she is going to need a NG Tube, a tube that is put in through her nose, which will pump nutrients into her stomach. </P>
<P>We will continue to observe her condition tomorrow, to see whether she’ll have to stay an extra 2 or 3 days this week with the tube, or to come next week to put in the tube.</P>

<P>I also brought Priscilla to visit Lydia today the whole day. It really cheered Lydia to have Priscilla there. They did math homework together on her bed. They played Gameboy together. And when Priscilla sat enjoying her meal, Lydia watched, and truly wanted to eat, but she just didn’t feel well…</P>

<P>&quot;Today I visited Lydia. Mom took me to the hospital to see her. In beginning of day when my mom woke me up, she told me to quickly change and we’d go to the hospital. Once we got there we met my dad and Lydia. We ordered breakfast and while we ate, Lydia checked my summer math homework. Afterwards we went to the activity room and made a flag that we hung in the window of the door. Then, we took an afternoon nap, and then played Gameboy. Finally we watched some TV, and watched Kim Possible the Movie. It truly was a fun day. And although I was there to cheer her up, I found myself being cheered up. As I sat with her, I got to see her feeling happy and having fun. Seeing her content, made me happy too…&quot; ~ Priscilla</P>

<P>Please continue to pray for Lydia’s condition: her nausea, need to gain weight, and adjustment to the NG tube as well as extensions in our hospital stay. </P>
