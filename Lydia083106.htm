</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>I closed Lydia’s bank account, evenly divided the balance into three parts, and deposited into her three siblings’ bank accounts. That was a heart breaking experience while stood in front of a teller in the bank explaining what I wanted to do.</P>
<P>We opened a minor bank account for each girl when they were very young. We gave them a small amount of allowance each month, so that they could learn to save money and also make offering to God with their own money.</P>
<P>They did not have much money in their accounts. Lately, Lydia’s account got a boost after she was diagnosed with cancer, because quite a few uncles and aunts gave Lydia monetary gifts. She spent very little of them, and deposited most of them into the bank. She said she wanted to save it for college…</P>
<P>When she was younger (before she was sick), knowing we have a lot of kids and with only single income, more than once, she asked me,</P>
<P>&quot;Daddy, do we have enough money for us to go to college?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don’t worry about that, God will provide.&quot; I answered her (I truly believe that), &quot;Besides, work hard, then you will get scholarship.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;OK.&quot; She nodded her head.</P>
<P>A few times, within recent seven months, after she received another monetary gift, she would say, &quot;I feel so sorry that sisters did not get these.&quot; Once (happened in her last hospital stay), she even said, &quot;Please give to my sisters, they did not get anything.&quot;</P>
<P>Thought about these conversations with Lydia, made me very very sad. A super big lump in my throat is very hurting, and made me heartache.</P>

<P>Last night, Priscilla could not fall asleep, and she wanted mom to be with her.  Priscilla picked up a book and gave to mom and said, </P>
<P>&quot;When I could not fall asleep, Lydia would read this book to me.&quot;</P>
<P>Mom choked up right away.  Mom could not read.  So mom held Priscilla to sleep.</P>
<P>For years, people would think Lydia and Priscilla were twins.  Although two years apart, they look very similar.  It’s difficult to see Priscilla alone.  Tell the truth, it’s very cruel.  But I got to believe God’s way is higher than ours.</P>
<P>Priscilla visited Lydia’s grave today.  There is a </FONT><A HREF="DSCN0037.JPG"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>temporary marker</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4> placed in Lydia’s grave now.  The permanent marker would come a few months later.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I read several chapters in the book of Job in the Bible today.  I would like to share 3:20-26 and 42:2-6.  Read what Job said thousand years ago brought me comfort.  Thank God for the book of Job, always one of my favorite.</P>
