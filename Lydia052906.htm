</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P>During the memorial long weekend, Lydia mostly felt all right.  Except Sunday morning, she did not feel good (maybe too many activities on Saturday), and did not go to church, and of course, Mom stayed home with her.</P>
<P>This evening, Deborah had the Memorial Day concert performance.  It was the last performance of the season for the youth orchestra which Deborah is the violinist.  Mom has been missing several Deborah’s concerts because of the need to take care of Lydia.  I got to go to all of them, somebody needed to give Deborah a ride.  But I know Deborah would like Mom to be there.</P>
<P>Tonight, Lydia would like to go to this concert, and she prayed for Deborah last night sincerely.  When we, entire family, arrived, we realized the adult orchestra would be playing the first half, and the youth concert was after intermission.  That’s all right, we just sat and enjoyed the music.  However, Lydia had headache during the first half of the concert and continued getting worse, and with fever.  So, during intermission I had to (very reluctant) take Mom, Lydia, Priscilla (she fell asleep anyway) home.  When I got back to the concert, it was almost over.  Esther was the only family member able to watch Deborah’s entire performance.</P>
<P>I was worried, during my driving back and forth, that Deborah may be upset about that Mom missed again, and it was family event to watch her performing.  It kind of ruined, because…</P>
<P>To my surprise, everybody was quite OK about it.  Actually, at night, Deborah massaged Lydia’s leg to help her to sleep.  Usually, that was Mom and Dad’s job.  Priscilla helped massaging too.  It was sweet.</P>
<P>It was very rare that a family outing would become this way.  Nowadays, things are just so unpredictable.  Who would have known, Lydia would suddenly not feeling well during a two hours long concert.  Maybe we just need to always drive two cars in the future, just in case…</P>
<P>Although situation like this has happened, and I was somewhat disappointed, the Lord still showed His way, through the siblings’ love and caring.  I thank the Lord for this.  There are always lessons, and beauty out of the difficult trials.</P></FONT></BODY>
