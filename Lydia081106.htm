</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Late last night, the doctor ordered a portable toilet, and placed next to Lydia’s bed. She was really excited about it, she thought she might be able to pee without help.</P>
<P>Early morning, mom had tearful eyes, because while Lydia tried to sit on the toilet seat (before mom could get to her, although mom told her to stop), she fell and bumped herself to the chair next to it. Then, we realized her ability to move around has further worsened. She is no longer able to stand even holding something. We could not believe only yesterday, she was able to use the walker and walk around…</P>
<P>The speed of her neurological deterioration really scared us. We have several discussions today with her doctor. There is only one more chemo drug we could add on to what we are using now, but we don’t know it would work or not. Today is the first time her doctor told us that Lydia’s disease might take her life. I guess it took a lot of courage for her doctor to say that (He likes Lydia so much. He always enjoyed hearing her talking.) Thank God, I did not feel anything particular. Our hope is from our Lord, the almighty God, not from the odds or the modern medical advancement.</P>
<P>Lydia also started to show some signs of difficulty of swallowing. Because of her high dose steroid, she felt hungry all the time. After we got food for her, not only she had trouble to contain food in her mouth, she had trouble to swallow it. I could not imagine the level of frustration it must have caused her. I only continue shedding my tear, hard to stop it, while watching her eating.</P>
<P>We had a lot of visitors today. Many did not get to see Lydia, because Lydia spent a lot of her awaken time trying to urinate. The longest one is over one hour, and not every time she would get the urine out. (She would not like the idea of bladder tube, she wants to urinate by herself.) A few visitors got to see Lydia and talked to her. Because Lydia could not speak clearly, she would apologize and explain it’s because her mouth could not close... I cried again and again hearing she said that.</P>
<P>Of course, Lydia had difficult communicating with people around her, even us. If we could not understand her, she would try to spell it, if the words have letter she could not spell, like B, P, M, V, F, etc. She would use her finger to write on her palm. Again, I cried watching her doing that.</P>
<P>Her memory continued going bad. She said she would like to find something good to eat, after so much efforts to put her on wheel chair, and all the tubes and IV stand ready, we walked out of her room, she forgot where we are heading and asked me. I answered her and cried while pushing the wheel chair.</P>
<P>With all these suffering and frustration, not able to remember, talk, eat, swallow, walk, urinate, close her eyes, close her mouth, and headache, and itchiness, her mood is sometimes very bad. Sometime, she could be so nice and sweet, and comforting mom don’t feel sad. Sometimes she could be very mean.</P>
<P>Quotes from Lydia when she is in good mood,</P>
<P>"Lord Jesus already told me I will get well. It may be soon, may be long after. And I know it will be hard."</P>
<P>"I love mommy and daddy, because you will never leave me." (She said that after visitors left.)</P>
<P>"Thank you for your prayer, I feel relieved."</P>
<P>"We just have to go by God’s will, not ours."</P></FONT></BODY>
