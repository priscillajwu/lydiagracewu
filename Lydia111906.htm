<h1>Sunday, November 19, 2006</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>This
morning before our own church Sunday worship, we got invited to speak to a
youth Sunday class. It was a great experience for us. It was also such a
rewarding experience for us to see how people would be touched by Lydia’s life.
We wish we could have more opportunity to share to more groups of people, if
God will open the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>A
few days ago, one of Lydia’s fourth grade teachers shared this with us … …<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>It
isn't as though I need a reminder to think of that magical little girl. But there
it is on my board in my classroom. Last year, I asked the 4th graders if anyone
would consider donating their money design projects that I might use it in the
future as an example. Selfless and willing, Lydia gave me hers. It is one of
two that I was given last year. Other kids really wanted to keep theirs, for
which I can't fault them. After their hard work, it is rightfully theirs! But
Lydia was willing to help others in extending that offer of using hers for the
future. Last week I got out those examples to share with this year's 4th
graders since they are ready to take their knowledge and create their own
currency. When I showed them the examples they were excited and impressed. When
I showed them Lydia's there was a collective sigh- they all held their breath
and just LOOKED. So many of those little ones knew Lydia from church or Symmes
Players. Then the praise started at her ingenuity, creativity, and problem
solving ability. The connections to the things she liked as she chose her
symbols (it was designed for &quot;Redville,&quot; her favorite color - as
those who knew informed the others). It went on and on! They held it up as a
stellar example. And it is, there is no denying it. We talked about the
aesthetic quality of the presentation. How well written her explanation is. I
just think they were touched to have a piece of her there with us to help us
learn. Does that surprise you? Always a teacher! It doesn't surprise me. And so
she's there when I turn around. A little piece, but a special piece with a very
tangible memory of a time I cherish that I knew a wonderful girl who taught ME
so much. Thank you. Again and again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Thank
you Lord, for using our beloved Lydia to teach us the life lessons you want us
to learn, thank you!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
