</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Today we held </FONT><A HREF="DSC0132.jpg"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>the memorial service</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>, the farewell celebration party for Lydia.</P>
<P>Although we had only ten family members present: mom and dad, Esther, Deborah, Priscilla, three grandparents, dad’s sister from California, and her daughter.  (Most Lydia’s uncles and aunts and cousins were in Taiwan and not able to come.)  However, we have seven to eight hundred extended families came together, many dressed red, from near and far, to celebrate Lydia’s ten years of life.  Although short, but it’s a life of faith, hope, love, courage, inspiration, and God’s amazing grace.</P>
<P>The service started with the Amazing Grace hymn played by the quartet of Esther (flute), Deborah (violin), Lydia’s piano and cello teachers.  Mom and dad got very emotional right away, since the quartet of four girls was broken.  (We could only have trio from now on.)</P>
<P>Amazing Grace was Lydia’s favorite hymn.  Lydia’s fourth grade teacher led the congregation singing this great hymn to worship the Lord.</P>
<P>A family friend gave a brief highlight of Lydia and our family.  Indeed, Lydia has lived her life to the fullest extent.  She was like a star shining from many aspects of her life.  She has stolen all our hearts.  We love her dearly, and we were extremely reluctant to let her go.</P>
<P>Deborah read John 3:16 (Lydia’s favorite verse), Priscilla read Isaiah 53: 4,5 (mom’s favorite), and Esther read 2 Timothy 4:7,8 (dad picked to describe Lydia’s life).</P>
<P>A hymn &quot;Beautiful&quot; was led by Lydia and all the children in the audience sang to praise the Lord Jesus.  How?  Back in May, Lydia led this song in the wedding ceremony.  It was recorded in the video tape.  Today, the tape was replayed.  &quot;…Jesus makes beautiful things of my life…&quot;  Again, we were totally torn.  My glasses were totally covered with tears.</P>
<P>The pastor’s message stated that Lydia’s life although short, but will be acknowledged by the Lord with the honor.</P>
<P>The remarks made by family friend described Lydia’s love of music and beauty of life.  Truly, Lydia enjoyed the life so much.  She tried her best in everything she did.  She did things sincerely and with her most efforts.  Her life has to shine…</P>
<P>The remarks made by Esther, Lydia’s oldest sister, were so real and true.  Lydia’s close walk with God, and her fight with the cancer, has earned the place of hero in Esther’s heart, surpassing parents or other great characters.</P>
<P>Mom made a long remark about Lydia, a dear treasure of mommy.  She told many stories about Lydia when she was little.  She also revealed the last words of Lydia.  It happened a few days before Lydia passed away.  Lydia suddenly woke up from her sleep, and saw mommy, &quot;Mommy, I love you.&quot;  Right away, Lydia hugged mommy.  Then, Lydia held her hands up high, and prayed, &quot;Jesus, Help me.&quot; Lydia’s faith and trust to the Lord persisted to the very end.</P>
<P>Dad’s remarks ended with the most said words by Lydia in her final days, &quot;Thank you&quot;, &quot;I love you, I love you all.&quot;  Indeed, Lydia’s appreciation and her love of people around her have touched so many hearts…</P>
<P>The burial was so difficult for us to endure.  We cried from the beginning to the end.  The extreme pain, the ultimate sorrow to bury my own child was a lot worse than anything I’ve ever experienced.  The piercing pain was tremendous, so great that I could hardly stand still.  I was shaking.  I held my stomach in one hand, and the other hand held one red rose.  While throwing the rose into the pit where Lydia’s body was placed, I cried so loud, so bad.  I felt like I am dying…  It was so painful.  I almost could not make it through.</P>
<P>Several red balloons were released to the sky.  That marked the end of Lydia’s funeral.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The director of the funeral home told me that he has never seen that many people in a child funeral.  He has been in the business for more than 30 years.  Even for adult, no matter how involved the deceased person in the community or how much contribution to the society, Lydia still got more people to visit her, coming to attend her funeral service.  Indeed, Lydia’s life has impacted many, not because of its length, or the earthly accomplishments, but because God’s name be glorified through her godly characters, loving, caring for others, perseverance, and most importantly, her unfailing faith.  She held the Lord tightly, never let go, her faith was never down.</P>

<P>I felt so bad that I did not get the chance to thank you one by one for coming to the farewell memorial service for Lydia, due to the time constraint.  We rushed to cemetery right after the service.  Many of you probably did not even get the chance to sign the guess book (the line was too long).  Please accept my apology.  Please let us know that you were here next time we meet or send us email.  We were greatly comforted by your presence.  </P>
<P>We know we were not alone, for God has sent you to be with us, and with the love and prayers in the Lord Jesus, our savior…</P>
