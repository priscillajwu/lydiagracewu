</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Lydia returned to the Children’s hospital before 9 AM for her second chemotherapy. Priscilla went with Lydia this time, since we believe Priscilla might keep Lydia distracted from the discomfort of chemotherapy, and make Lydia somewhat easier or happier.</P>
<P>We have been praying that since it’s the second time, hope this time things would get easier…</P>
<P>Actually, I’ve heard three different scenarios from people who had experience of chemotherapy. Some got better and better each time, since the body got used to it. Some got worse and worse each time, since the body never got used to it and health condition was worse each time. Some had no pattern, sometimes got better, sometimes got worse, and did not know what to expect every single time.</P>
<P>Well, the procedure did get smoother today. Lydia got her IV and chemo medicine faster than last time.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, Lydia developed very high blood pressure, so high even for adult. Lydia’s blood pressure has been very low, this kind of blood pressure reading has never occurred in her life. (I recalled last time first day of first chemotherapy, her blood pressure got scary low, this time was totally opposite, although with the same chemo medicine.) She also developed some fever and rash. These were all different from last time. I got abdominal pain again seeing Lydia had all these reactions. However, the doctors said, all these were possible, just need to take close monitor on her.</P>
<P>During the evening, I took all Lydia’s siblings to accompany Lydia in the hospital. That really helped.</P>
<P>Before midnight, the situations were better controlled. However, she still need to go to restroom every 15-30 minutes for 24 hours (won’t be able to sleep well), to make sure her kidney and other organs would not get damaged because of the toxic chemo medicines.</P>
<P>We continue praying that God would watch Lydia for next few days of chemotherapy.</P></FONT></BODY>
