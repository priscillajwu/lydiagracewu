it is a memory, but it is a reminder of how she touched our lives…even away
from Cincinnati. For those in college, those in Cleveland, I even had friends
in Michigan who knew about Lydia and were praying for her. That's how much she
was loved and how much she had touched us. How much we felt the loss as well.
So for her story to be told, I wrote this.</span></i></span><i><span

style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>its been a week
exactly.<br>
its hard to gather all of your thoughts after a time like that...<br>
i've been sitting here typing and deleting, typing and deleting...<br>
the email that was written by the boy that was read--i feel just like him...<br>
i feel like i've lost a friend.<br>
<br>
i was off in college when i first heard about lydia. i didn't know her that
well but i remember always seeing the sisters traveling in packs of 4, always
helping each other out, following esther. They were always on their best
behavior wherever they went. I remember going to the Mason church to talk to
the parents and afterwards they wanted us to spend some time with the children.
Being the typical little kids, they had a short attention span and i'm pretty
sure they weren't interested in what we had to say. but as i looked out in the
crowd, i remember seeing lydia just sitting there and trying to tell the girls
that she was sitting with to quiet down and listen to what we had to say. i
don't remember how old she was, but she just had this aura about her cause
people listened to her. <br>
<br>
All i had to know what was going on were the updates. and i felt like i was
going on the journey with the family. My heart went out to the family, to the
girls. I remember when i was in cleveland for piano camp one summer and they
were living there, they kept an eye out for me, made sure everything was
alright. They are always looking out for people. I think that's where lydia got
her caring heart for others. So to hear the stories of how she kept giving back
to others even in her time of sickness only gave us a bigger picture of how big
her heart was. <br>
<br>
When i went to the hospital after getting back from taiwan-- she was still
fighting for life, talking to us, keeping the focus off of her. She couldn't
see us that well but she still asked who we were and pointed us all out.
&quot;i love you, thank you&quot; those were the words that came out of her
mouth. Even to us, she said it...and i didn't even know her that well. a heart
of a warrior.<br>
<br>
what got me the most was how many people had showed up for her celebration to
see how many people she had touched with the joys of her life. through singing,
playing the piano, the cello, even school, she did it with a smile.<br>
the displays were beautiful, the words from friends at church and school to
lydia hit a chord. people came from Cleveland, from her neighborhood,
everywhere near and far. And for those who have read about her or even heard
about her, for the continued prayers, they were there that day. For that
afternoon, we were all a family. We were all missing Lydia. <br>
<br>
Thank you for sharing her with us. Seeing the slideshow, singing her favorite
song, at the end, I realized, she DID have a good life. She did her deed. just
how we all came together to talk about her life, her triumphs, her victories.
she touched our hearts, she planted her seed in us. we were lucky to know her
while she was still here. she lives in us and her story WILL live on. She is at
a better place. My friend is looking down on us. <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shapetype
