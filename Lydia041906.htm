</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>The tapes and marks (made by permanent markers for positioning purpose of radiation) on Lydia’s body in many places were no longer needed for the second part of radiation.  We started to wash them away slowly.  They were almost all gone today.  It feels good.  Praise the Lord.</P>
<P>Lydia helped Mom doing some yard work this afternoon.  She dug out some worms and put into a box with some soil in it.  She said she would like to go fishing...  </P>
<P>It’s good to see her doing some activities like these.  Compared with her conditions a few weeks ago, Lydia is definitely doing better.</P>
<P>Thank you for your prayers.</P>
<P>God bless</P>
