</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Every radiation would make Lydia not feel well both physically and emotionally.</P>
<P>Today, after radiation, when Mom and Lydia arrived home, Lydia did not want to get off the car, she was not feeling good, and was very tired. (And she knows nobody was home, Daddy was at work, all her sisters were at school.)</P>
<P>"Why don’t you come in and sleep." Mom asked.</P>
<P>"No, I rather fall asleep here in the car. Hopefully when I wake up. All of these will be over…." Lydia answered.</P>
<P>This made Mommy very sad.</P>
<P>Tonight, although it’s Friday night, it was a tough night. Lydia was in a lot of pain. I encouraged her to do something. She said she could not concentrate because of the pain…</P>
<P>After Mom and girls came back from church, I did not have enough patience left for them. I was soon aware of that. I prayed that God have mercy on us.</P>
<P>Truly, I have not seen the light from the other end of tunnel yet. So, I don’t know how long this tunnel would be. But thank God for He is holding us to get through. I also thank God that there are many people accompanying us, and with many prayers. </P>
<P>As I am writing this letter such late in the night, I thank God for the peace in my mind…</P>
