<BR>
Praise the Lord for His grace and mercy. Lydia was out of ICU and moved to regular room. Recovery goes well.<BR>
<BR>
Physical therapist helps her slowly turn her head in different directions, also encourages her to get off the bed and walk. She feels painful and dizzy but makes progress. Such a brave girl! <BR>
<BR>
Docs will have a meeting with the parents tomorrow (2/14, Tues) regarding the future treatment.<BR>
<BR>
She was happy to see those gifts and cards from Mason congregation, wanted to thank all of you. <BR>
<BR>
If you want to visit her, make sure she is not in sleep before you enter the room, because she's been suffering the pains and didn't have enough sleep (record high: only 3 contineuos hours after surgery).<BR>
<BR>
It may not be a bad idea that let Lydia's friends talk (or say Hi) to her through VHS/DVD. (she can see them in her room).<BR>
<BR>
Again, please keep praying for her and her family. Thank you all.<BR>
<BR>
May God remember your faithful prayers and bless you all<BR>
