<div class=Section1><pre>July 2, 2006, Sunday</pre>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>To cheer up Lydia, I tried
to come up with something fun. It has to be something special, and we could not
go far away (the doctors and nurses have been reminded us again and again, do
not go out of town or too far away, just in case Lydia needs any emergency
care).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Lydia and Priscilla wanted
to watch movie. I was not sure that was a good idea, since there would be a lot
of people in the theater and it’s indoors. Then, I decided to go to the Winton
Woods which has a boat house. We could have some fun renting the boat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>It was terrible. I deeply
regretted the idea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>When we got there, I wanted
to get something easy like motor boat. However, Lydia wanted the pedal boat, so
she can pedal. For motor boat, she could only sit there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>The weather was very hot,
up in 90’s. There was no shade in the pedal boat. Priscilla soon started
whining, and made everybody in the boat miserable. We were in the middle of the
lake, and had trouble to maneuver the boat. Lydia tried very hard to pedal (she
had hat and long sleeve clothes and pants in such a hot weather), but Priscilla
just would not cooperate, and whine all the way. It was really too hot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>So, we had to rush home
shortly. I was really angry with Priscilla, and that made her crying and felt
really sorry…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>What happened later was
that Lydia helped Priscilla feel better by sitting next to her and held
Priscilla in her arms. She said it was all her fault. That calmed me down all
of sudden. I felt extremely bad. I had to pray, and realized my weakness. I had
to apologize.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Something to make up in the
evening. We bought a small air inflated water pool last week. Since it’s so
hot, I made it to work in the back yard. Lydia, Priscilla, and I were </span><a
href="100_9492.JPG"><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>in the
water</span></a><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'> having a lot
of fun. They have forgotten what happened earlier today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>I found a long piece of
hair in the water, &quot;Whose hair?&quot; I asked while brought the hair out
of the water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;It can’t be mine,
since now I do not have hair.&quot; Lydia laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Not mine, I don’t
have hair either.&quot; I said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;OK, OK, it’s
mine.&quot; Priscilla said and also laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Although we were joking
around, hearing Lydia said she does not have hair, still got me a bit of tears
in my eyes…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Well, thank God for the
day. A lot of lessons to learn…<o:p></o:p></span></p>
